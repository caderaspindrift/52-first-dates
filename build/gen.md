## Create-a-Prospect from []{.gamename}

[](https://spindriftgames.itch.io/52-first-dates){.gamename} 
is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

This is an excerpt from that game; specifically, the rules for randomly generating
a (singlet) date, called a Prospect, using a deck of playing cards.

There are three types of players for any given Date Night:

- The Collective, who jointly share the plural character called the System;
- The Date, who plays the singlet character called the Prospect;
- Opportunity, who introduce Opportunity Events to make the date a little less predicable.

### A System Introduction {#our-system .nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:

### Creating the Prospect {#setup-prospect}

::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Everyone is involved in creating the Prospect as well.](art/spectrum/selfies.jpg){.bottom}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Creating a new Prospect happens before each Date Night -- unless you're going
on a second date with someone from a previous Date Night.
As with creating the System and the Headmates, creation of a new Prospect
involves input from everyone.

The steps to creating a new Prospect are:

1. Name the Prospect
2. Determine the Prospect's pronouns
3. See how the Prospect compares to the ideal
4. Describe the Prospect's appearance
5. Draw 2 cards for Traits

Each of these is detailed in the following sections.

#### Gender and Attraction

One thing that *isn't* on the list is "determine the Prospect's gender
and attraction." Why's that?
[An earlier draft had this section as "Gender and Sexuality," but we realized
that sexuality isn't really the only thing we're talking about here. So 
we switched it to "attraction".]{.carline}

The assumption for game purposes is that the Prospect's gender and attraction
are going to be generally compatible with the System's gender and attraction.
While this is rarely a reasonable assumption to make in real life, it works
for purposes of the game -- because this ultimately isn't a game about being 
rejected by queer people, either by the System or by the Prospect.

Which means that it's handwaved as a non-issue -- if you need more of an
explanation than that, you can say that the friend-who-set-up-the-blind-date
[Speaking of the "friend", if you ever need to figure out details about said
mutual friend, such as their name or pronouns, you can use the tables for
creating a Prospect for them as well.]{.dera}
knows the System and the Prospect well enough to make sure that they at least
have a *chance* to hit it off in terms of compatibility.


#### The Prospect's Name {#setup-prospect-name}

You can quickly determine a name for the Prospect by drawing a single card from the
top of the Date's Deck, and comparing it to the following tables.
These names have been chosen to have few gender assumptions attached.
[Any player is free to veto any names that have negative associations for them,
no questions asked -- this is a place where safety tools help out]{.carline}

#### The Prospect's Pronouns {#setup-prospect-pronouns}

Once you have the name of the Propect, you'll need their pronouns.
Draw one card to determine their primary pronoun, and then draw a second
to determine another set of pronouns they also use. 
[Here's a mnemonic for these -- **S**pades starts with an "S", as does
"she/her"; **H**earts and "he/him" with an "H"; **C** for both Clubs and
*chart*. There's no "d" in they/them, though.]{.spin}

First Card Suit         Second Card Suit        Pronouns
---                     ---                     ---------
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.hearts   }   Hearts any pronouns
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.spades   }   Spades she/her
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.diamonds } Diamonds she/her + they/them
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.clubs    }    Clubs she/her + chart <br/>
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.hearts   }   Hearts he/him
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.spades   }   Spades any pronouns
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.diamonds } Diamonds he/him + they/them
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.clubs    }    Clubs he/him + chart <br/>
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.hearts   }   Hearts chart + he
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.spades   }   Spades chart + she
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.diamonds } Diamonds chart + they
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.clubs    }    Clubs chart + chart
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.hearts   }   Hearts they/them + he/him
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.spades   }   Spades they/them + she/her
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.diamonds } Diamonds they/them
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.clubs    }    Clubs theythem + chart <br/>

If the result above says "chart" (i.e., is Clubs) then check the card's
rank on the next table.

#### Is This an Ideal Partner? {#setup-prospect-qualities}

During the Headmate creation part of the game, you wrote one quality that the
Headmate was looking for in an ideal partner.
Now it's time to see if the Prospect measures up to that ideal. Here's how you
do that.

- For each Headmate, the Date writes the Headmate's name and desired quality on a line on the Date Sheet.
- One player flips the top card from the System's Deck and the Date flips a card from the Date's Deck.
- If the cards **don't match at all,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality.
- If the cards **match color,** the Date marks a check on that line; the Prospect has that desired quality.
- If the cards **match suit,** the Date marks a plus (+); the Prospect has that quality in abundance!
- If the cards **match suit and rank,** the Date marks a star; the Prospect is a perfect match on that quality!
- If the cards **match rank but not suit or color,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality at all. The Date marks a minus (-) on that line.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here's an example. Let's say the Headmate's desired criteria is
"enjoys tabletop RPGs" -- so that they have someone to share their hobby with.

The player holding that sheet and the Date both flip cards; we'll keep the player's card
consistent, with a Two of []{.hearts} Hearts, and examine different draws by the
Date.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .nine .c}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this case, the cards don't match at all. The Date doesn't put any mark on that line.
The Prospect isn't into TTRPGs.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .ten .d}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards' colors match. The Date marks a checkmark in the box. The Prospect plays TTRPGs,
hooray!

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Seven of Hearts]{.card .seven .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The colors match, but more important, the suits also match. The Date puts a "+" on the
corresponding line. The Prospect not only plays roleplaying games, but really likes the hobby.
Maybe they're a gamemaster, or just a die-hard roleplayer?

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards exactly match, one from each deck. 
[There's a 1 in 52 chance of this happening, which is 1.92% of the time.]{.dera}
["Never tell me the odds."]{.aura}
[Han Solo is kind of a creep, though.]{.carline}
We can intrepret this as not only does the Prospect play tabletop RPGs as often as
the Headmate, *but also* their group is looking for a new player!
The Date player marks a star in the box. 

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Spades]{.card .deuce .s}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Uh oh. The ranks match, but the suits don't match either color or suit.

The Date marks a "-" in the box. Not only does the date not play tabletop roleplaying
games, but actively *dislikes* them. This could spell problems for that Headmate.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


#### The Prospect's Appearance {#setup-prospect-appearance}

To learn what the Prospect looks like, we use the same technique that gave
the description of the System: Each player provides one part of the
Prospect's general look, and the Date player records those on the Date
Sheet.

Simple, isn't it?


#### The Prospect's Traits {#setup-prospect-traits}

When you've completed the rest of the details about the Prospect, the Date player
draws two cards from the top of the Date's Deck, placing them face down in front of them.

Each card is tied to one personality Trait; these are listed in the table below, as well
as on the Date Sheet.
The Date player uses these cards as a guideline when roleplaying the Prospect. 
In addition, the trait cards are used in the Wrap-Up phase to 
determine the outcome of Date Night.

If you're the Date, don't reveal the two trait cards until Date Night is over! This is
the only situation in []{.gamename} where anyone is meant to keep secrets from other
players -- it's to maintain a sense of surprise and mystery.
