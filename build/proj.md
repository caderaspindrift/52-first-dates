# 52 First Dates

[]{.gamename} is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session (or even ever)!
More likely you'll just play out a few, either a pre-arranged number or until
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop.

## What You Need {.nobreak}

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least three players; preferably four to six, and usually no more than eight
- Two decks of standard poker cards; they should have different backs
- One copy of the System Sheet
- One copy of the Outside Interference Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- One Headmate Sheet per player
- One Game Reference Sheet per player
- Pencils
- *optional, but recommended* Extra paper for notetaking

## The Purpose of []{.gamename} {.nobreak}

This game attempts to do four things at once. It's up to you, the players, to determine
if it succeeds at any of those. The four goals are to be a game that:

1. Has multiple players playing the same character
2. Educates about plural systems
3. Functions as an interesting dating sim
4. Is actually fun to play

## Game Design Philosophy

Our take on indie game design[Dera totally wrote this section, she's so wordy]{.aura} 
is that of an ongoing conversation where a number of
different voices weave in and out with their contributions that answer the question,
"What *is* a roleplaying game? What *can* a roleplaying game *be*?"

All of our games are made with that in mind: this is our part in the conversation,
right here, right now. We may have more to add later, but this is what we want to say
now.

Very few concepts in the game are *completely* new. For example, card-based games 
have long been a part of the hobby, to varying degrees of success. Romance/dating 
sim tabletop RPGs aren't as common, but they're out there -- most notably by
[Emily Care Boss](http://www.blackgreengames.com/) in her
[*Romance Trilogy*](http://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf).
<a name="anchor-ecb"></a>

Games where many players run the same character are even more rare; and I don't
know of any that address it from the standpoint of a plural, shared character.
If you do, let me know!

But just as nobody invents all the words they speak, the magic isn't in the parts
you use but how you assemble them -- or even beyond that, in what you *actually*
say with those words.

Hopefully we'll be able to communicate our message to you as you play []{.gamename}!

## A System Introduction {#our-system .nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:

~    Primary (co-)fronter and project coordinator; she/her

[No Fascists]{.sidehead .inclu}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 
[No, really, we mean it. This isn't for fascists.]{.carline}

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn.

## Glossary of Game Terms {#glossary}

Before we dive into game mechanics, these are the terms used in the game.

Player <a name="glossary-player"></a>
~   This means what you think it means -- one of you who are reading this
    and, hopefully, playing the game at some point. There are no 
    gamemasters in this game, only players.

The System <a name="glossary-system"></a>
~   A fictional character created by all the players and played jointly between
    all of them. This character is a plural system, and has been set up
    on a date by a friend.

Headmates <a name="glossary-headmates"></a>
~   One of the members of the System's plural system. While there are as
    many headmates as there are players, a headmate is *not* tied to one
    player as "their" character.

Date Night <a name="glossary-date-night"></a>
~   This is the actual event of the blind date between the System and the
    Date character. It doesn't have to take place at night; you can have
    it happen at any time. 
    When Date Night occurs, the Prospect character is created (or carries over
    from a previous date), and the roles are assigned.

The Prospect <a name="glossary-prospect"></a>
~   For any given Date Night, this is the fictional character the System
    has been set up with for a blind date. The Prospect has their own desires
    and personality, separate from those of the System.

Roles <a name="glossary-roles"></a>
~   For Date Night, there are three roles: **The Date**, **The Fronters**,
    and **The Outside Interference**. These change between dates, and may
    change during a date as well. Roles are determined randomly at the
    start of Date Night.

The Date <a name="glossary-date"></a>
~   The player who is currently controlling the fictional actions of the
    Prospect character, playing their cards to help describe how the
    Prospect acts toward, and reacts to, the System.

The Fronter(s) <a name="glossary-fronter"></a>
~   The player or players (for a game with 4+ players) who are actively
    controlling the System by playing cards. With more than one Fronter,
    they alternate turns between each other. The Fronters roleplay the
    System as whichever Headmate is fronting at the time, which can
    change during the game.

The Outside Interference <a name="glossary-outside-interference"></a>
~   The player who is controlling "the rest of the world", and introducing
    elements into the fictional Date Night to complicate the potential
    love connection between the System character and the Date character.

The Date's Deck <a name="glossary-date-deck"></a>
~   The deck of cards from which both the Date and the Outside Interference
    draw their cards.

The System's Deck <a name="glossary-system-deck"></a>
~   The deck of cards from which all the Fronters draw their cards. It's
    a good idea to a System Deck with a different card back than the 
    Date Deck, as the two will get mixed together frequently.

The Status Stacks <a name="glossary-status-stacks"></a>
~   A row of three cards, situated between the players, upon which they
    play their cards. Only the top card matters, so the Status Stacks
    don't need to be laid out like solitaire game -- just as three 
    distinct piles.

End of the Date <a name="glossary-end-date"></a>
~   When all of the cards on the Status Stack show the same suit or the
    same rank, it's time to wrap up that Date Night. The cards determine
    if the System and the Date share an intimate moment, want to date
    again, both, or neither.

Achieving Intimacy <a name="glossary-achieving-intimacy"></a>
~   One of the two main outcomes of Date Night. "Intimacy" is a deliberately
    broad term, allowing this to include everything from physical sex to
    a long night talking about feelings, at the option of the players.

Getting a Second Date <a name="glossary-second-date"></a>
~   The other main outcome of Date Night. The Prospect character is willing to
    see the System again, and the players collectively can decide if they'd
    like to do that, or go on a date with someone else.

Aftercare <a name="glossary-aftercare"></a>
~   This is another broad term, adapted from the TTRPG Safety Toolkit.
    It's a recognition that even dating vicariously through a fictional
    character can stir up emotions, and players may need time to process
    those.


## Part 1: The Set-Up {#setup}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Nobody wants to have a panic attack just from playing a roleplaying game.](art/spectrum/panic.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that you know how the cards work, we're going to tell you how 
the game is set up.
["the set-up" has a double meaning, see, because not only is this section about
preparing the game, but the whole conceit of the game is that it's a blind
date that you were *set up* on]{.aura}

Before the first Date Night, you have to do the following:

- Go over basic safety procedures
- Decide on the setting and themes of the game
- Create the System
- Create the Headmates

Before *each* Date Night, including the first, you need to:

- Create the Prospect
- Assign Roles
- Set the Scene


### Creating the System {#setup-system .breakbefore}

### Creating the Headmates {#setup-headmates .breakbefore}

Once you've created the System, you need to create Headmates.

1. Write down a name or nickname for the headmate.
2. Write down pronouns for the headmate.
3. Write down a sexuality for the headmate. 
4. Write down something that interests the headmate.
5. Write down the general demeanor or personality of the headmate.
6. Write down one quality the headmate is looking for in a potential partner.
7. Introduce us to this headmate.

## Appendix: A Plural Lexicon <a name="lexicon"></a>

These are important terms about plural systems that you may to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/).
As always, our own notes are included in the footnotes, marked by 
our identifying emoji ([](#our-system){.page}).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: lexicon ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Blending <a name="lexicon-blending"></a>
~   Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
    to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
    or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.
    [Our own median system does this a lot; part of why we didn't recognize ourself
     as a system was because we blend from to the other and don't even notice that
     our fronter has changed]{.aura}

Blurian <a name="lexicon-blurian"></a>
~   Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
    significant amnesic barriers. 
    Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
    contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
    members and memory sharing.
    [For game purposes, we assume the protagonist System to be blurian.]{.dera}

Co-Conscious  <a name="lexicon-co-conscious"></a>
~   Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when 
    multiple headmates are active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in 
    that these headmates aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace 
    or otherwise experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

Co-Fronting <a name="lexicon-co-fronting"></a>
~   Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
    them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

Core <a name="lexicon-core"></a>
~   The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
    Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
    not plural.  The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or 
    memories of the pre-plural self.

Endogenic <a name="lexicon-endogenic"></a>
~   Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
    traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
    opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
    even within the same system.

Fronting <a name="lexicon-fronting"></a>
~   Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
    take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
    This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
    communication.

Frontstuck <a name="lexicon-frontstuck"></a>
~   A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
    More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

Front Trigger <a name="lexicon-front-trigger"></a>
~   Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
    cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
    These can be both negative and positive.

Forced Fronting <a name="lexicon-forced-fronting"></a>
~   Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
    in the system.
    This is not the same as frontstuck (c.f.) as the headmate is not unable to 
    leave front; they simply don't want to.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![These are just a handful of the terms used by plural people to describe our experiences. Different systems, or even different members of the same systems, might use different terminology.](art/spectrum/newspaper.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Headmate <a name="lexicon-headmate"></a>
~   A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
    They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
    partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

Headspace <a name="lexicon-headspace"></a>
~   A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
    members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.
    Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
    Singlets may have a headspace as well.
    [We don't have a headspace. We tried making one as a pirate ship, but that didn't
     work out.]{.dera}

Host <a name="lexicon-host"></a>
~   A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
    activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.
    Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 

Introject <a name="lexicon-introject"></a>
~   Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
    identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
    system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
    seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

    The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
    every system. 

Little <a name="lexicon-little"></a>
~   A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
    This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
    systems based on their body's age.
    [We decided that having headmates who are littles actively participate in a
     dating sim game was ... not a great idea. So if the System has any littles
     in it, we consider them "offscreen" during the game.]{.carline}

Main <a name="lexicon-main"></a>
~   The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
    main or central influences on the system.
    [Spinny was our main before but we feel more comfortable now with a shared responsibility model]{.aura}
    This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
    often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
    an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

Median <a name="lexicon-median"></a>
~   A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
    distinct or separate from each other.
    [This is what we are! a median system]{.aura}
    It can be considered being somewhere 
    between multiple and singlet.

    Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
    in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
    between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

    Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
    system are distinct.

Memory Sharing <a name="lexicon-memory-sharing"></a>
~   Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
    memories with others in the same system.
    This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. 
    Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.
    [For the sake of the game, we decided that the System's members all have
     shared memories.]{.dera}

Mixed Origin  <a name="lexicon-mixed-origin"></a>
~   Mixed origin refers to a system that has multiple different 
    system origins. This could be because their system formed from a combination of 
    factors, or that not all of their headmates are of the same origin.

Multiple <a name="lexicon-multiple"></a>
~   A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
    physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.
    The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
    system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

Parogenic <a name="lexicon-parogenic"></a>
~   Parogenic refers to systems or headmates that were created using thought-based 
    or metaphysical means, usually deliberately.
    Tulpamancy (c.f.) is a related concept, but the term is avoided by some systems 
    due to its origins or other reasons. 

Partitionary <a name="lexicon-partitionary"></a>
~   A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
    particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
    memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
    and resulting time loss.

    Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
    for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
    rest of the system or subsystem.
    [The assumption for the *game* is that the System is not overly partitionary,
     so that players don't have to roleplay lack of memory and such.]{.dera}

Persecutor <a name="lexicon-persecutor"></a>
~   A persecutor is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
    body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
    Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
    and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
    abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 
    [We used to have a persecutor, but we worked some things out.]{.spin} 

Plurality <a name="lexicon-plurality"></a>
~   Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
    single body. Plural experiences are extremely diverse. 
    Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, median or partitionary, 
    small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

Pluralphobe <a name="lexicon-pluralphobe"></a>
~   A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
    systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

Protector <a name="lexicon-protector"></a>
~   A protector is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
    from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.
    [Valorie is a protector in our system.]{.spin} 

Quoigenic  <a name="lexicon-quoigenic"></a>
~   Quoigenic is an origin term that means the user does not want 
    to share their origins, does not think it's relevant, or thinks it's 
    the wrong question to ask.  It's derived from the French word "quoi", 
    which approximately means "what".

Role[This isn't the a "role" in way we use it in the game.]{.dera} <a name="lexicon-role"></a>
~   A role is the position a member takes within their system.
    This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
    or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

Singlet  <a name="lexicon-singlet"></a>
~   Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words 
    doesn't share their body with anyone else.  It's not a binary distinction, as 
    people may be questioning being plural, and median can be viewed as a 
    continuum with singlet at one end.

Switching  <a name="lexicon-switching"></a>
~   Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.
    This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
    something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
    The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.
    Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
    result in blend states in the in-between time.

System <a name="lexicon-system"></a>
~   A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
    that share a single physical plural body.
    The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
    different. 

    Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
    names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
    than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
    with adjectives applied.
    [Our system name is "The Spindrift Crew".]{.spin}

System Exclusionist[Don't be one of these. They suck.]{.val} <a name="lexicon-system-exclusionist"></a>
~   A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
    about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
    'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
    apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. 
    

Traumagenic <a name="lexicon-traumagenic"></a>
~   Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
    more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
    fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.
