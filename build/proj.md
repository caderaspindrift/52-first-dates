# 52 First Dates

[]{.gamename} is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session (or even ever)!
More likely you'll just play out a few, either a pre-arranged number or until
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop.

## What You Need {.nobreak}

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least three players; preferably four to six, and usually no more than eight
- Two decks of standard poker cards; they should have different backs
- One copy of the System Sheet
- One copy of the Outside Interference Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- One Headmate Sheet per player
- One Game Reference Sheet per player
- Pencils
- *optional, but recommended* Extra paper for notetaking

## The Purpose of []{.gamename} {.nobreak}

This game attempts to do four things at once. It's up to you, the players, to determine
if it succeeds at any of those. The four goals are to be a game that:

1. Has multiple players playing the same character
2. Educates about plural systems
3. Functions as an interesting dating sim
4. Is actually fun to play

## Game Design Philosophy

Our take on indie game design[Dera totally wrote this section, she's so wordy]{.ora} 
is that of an ongoing conversation where a number of
different voices weave in and out with their contributions that answer the question,
"What *is* a roleplaying game? What *can* a roleplaying game *be*?"

All of our games are made with that in mind: this is our part in the conversation,
right here, right now. We may have more to add later, but this is what we want to say
now.

Very few concepts in the game are *completely* new. For example, card-based games 
have long been a part of the hobby, to varying degrees of success. Romance/dating 
sim tabletop RPGs aren't as common, but they're out there -- most notably by
[Emily Care Boss](http://www.blackgreengames.com/) in her
[*Romance Trilogy*](http://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf).

Games where many players run the same character are even more rare; and I don't
know of any that address it from the standpoint of a plural, shared character.
If you do, let me know!

But just as nobody invents all the words they speak, the magic isn't in the parts
you use but how you assemble them -- or even beyond that, in what you *actually*
say with those words.

Hopefully we'll be able to communicate our message to you as you play []{.gamename}!

## A System Introduction {.nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:

:::::::::::::: systemlist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- []{.spin} **Cadera Spindrift**, primary fronter and project coordinator (she/her)
- []{.dera} **Dera**, our analytical headmate and game mechanics wonk (she/her)
- []{.carline} **Carline Stone**, social justice druid and in-house sensitivity reader (she/her)
- []{.ora} **Aura**, flirty lesbian disaster (she/her)
- []{.val} **Valorie**, generally quiet protector (she/her)
- []{.fox} who doesn't speak or write except in emojis; not a fox (fae/him/it/them)

[No Fascists]{.sidehead .inclu}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 
[No, really, we mean it. This isn't for fascists.]{.carline}

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

[]{.lorem}

Despite the name of the game, it's entirely possible to get a second date. 
If the Date didn't ghost you, and the players reach consensus on going out 
again, play a second date (amd all subsequent dates) with these changes: 

- **Switch Roles** Select a new player to play the Date role, from the
  players who didn't play the Date. Then select another player to play 
  the Outside Interference who hasn't played the Outside Interference
  in this game.

- **Keep the Date's Personality Cards** You don't have to remove them
  from the Date Deck, just note them down on the on the Second Date part
  of the Date Sheet. These serve as guidelines for roleplaying as the
  Date.

- **Draw Two More Personality Cards for the DAte** In a second date, you're 
  usually going to be past the initial awkwardness, and you can find out 
  there's more to your date than you original assumed.

- **Decide What Happened Between Dates** []{.lorem}

#### Going Steady {#date-next-steady}

[]{.lorem}

If the Date is up for a third date, then you are officially Going Steady.  
Unless the system (or its members) are lesbians -- in which case you're 
moving in together.

## Part 3: The Wrap-Up {#wrap}

After a game session of []{.gamename}, it's very strongly recommended that you have a
wrap-up discussion. Some groups might want to do this after every date, to reflect and
talk about whatever issues arose.



### Aftercare {#wrap-after}

[]{.lorem}


### Topics of Discussion {#wrap-discuss}

[]{.lorem}


### Wait, Am *I* Plural?  {#wrap-wait}

For some people, playing []{.gamename} might line up some dots in your life, and you might
question whether not you might be plural yourself.
Before we go any further, we want to say something very important:

***This game was not designed for helping you discover if you're plural or not.***
We didn't design it that way.[Among other reasons, we don't have the expertise to do so.]{.carline}
[]{.gamename} is a simulation that might give you empathy for what it's like being
plural, and reading the game materials could educate you -- especially the 
[More Than One](#more) section.

That said, if you want to investigate further, the [Plural Resources](#resources) 
appendix has a number of links that can help you learn more about the plural experience
and what it might mean in your life.<span class="carline">If this game does play a 
role in any way determining if you're plural -- or *not!* -- drop

## Appendix: A Plural Lexicon {#lexicon}

These are important terms about plural systems that you may to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: lexicon ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- **Amnesiac System**
  An amnesiac system is one with limited or no memory sharing. Headmates don't 
  remember the time while other headmates are fronting and may experience this 
  gap as time loss.

- **Blending**
  Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
  to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
  or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.

- **Blurian**
  Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
  significant amnesic barriers. This term is usually paired with other terms 
  to describe a system, and itself has no correlation to the identities 
  within the given system.

  Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
  contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
  members and memory sharing.

- **Co-Conscious** Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when 
  multiple headmates are active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in 
  that these headmates aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace 
  or otherwise experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

- **Co-Fronting**
  Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
  them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

- **Core**
  The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
  Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
  not plural.  The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or 
  memories of the pre-plural self.

- **Endogenic**
  Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
  traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
  opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
  even within the same system.

- **Fronting**
  Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
  take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
  This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
  communication.
  In some cases, it's possible for no one to be fronting, in which case 
  some type of default behavior takes over the body. This can surface in 
  multiple ways, such as becoming unresponsive.

- **Frontstuck**
  A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
  More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

- **Front Trigger**
  Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
  cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
  These can be both negative and positive.

- **Forced Fronting**
  Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
  in the system.
  This is not the same as frontstuck as the headmate is not unable to leave front; 
  they simply don't want to.

- **Headmate**
  A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
  They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
  partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

- **Headspace**
  A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
  members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.
  Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
  Singlets may have a headspace as well.

- **Host**
  A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
  activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.
  Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 
  In addition, some do not like the term "host", and choose to use alternatives; 
  specifically, outernaut.

- **Introject**
  Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
  identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
  system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
  seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

  The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
  every system. It should be checked first if a system is comfortable being 
  referred to as such or not.

- **Little**
  A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
  This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
  systems based on their body's age.

- **Main**
  The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
  main or central influences on the system. This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
  often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
  an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

- **Median**
  A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
  distinct or separate from each other. It can be considered being somewhere 
  between multiple and singlet.

  Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
  in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
  between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

  The entities which inhabit a median system are known as "aspects" or "facets". 
  Some median systems may identify as different archetypes. Despite being more 
  fluid and similar, median systems can be very diverse.

  Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
  system are distinct.

- **Memory Sharing**
  Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
  memories with others in the same system.
  This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. 
  Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.

- **Mixed Origin** Mixed origin refers to a system that has multiple different 
  system origins. This could be because their system formed from a combination of 
  factors, or that not all of their headmates are of the same origin.

- **Multiple**
  A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
  physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.
  The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
  system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

- **Parogenic**
  Parogenic refers to systems or headmates that were created using thought-based 
  or metaphysical means, usually deliberately.
  Tulpamancy is a related concept, but the term is avoided by some systems 
  due to its origins or other reasons. Similarly, parogenic may be avoided by 
  some systems in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic.

- **Partitionary**
  A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
  particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
  memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
  and resulting time loss.
  Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
  for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
  rest of the system or subsystem.

- **Persecutor**
  A **persecutor** is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
  body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
  Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
  and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
  abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 

- **Plurality**
  Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
  single body. Plural experiences are extremely diverse. 
  Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, median or partitionary, 
  small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

- **Pluralphobe**
  A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
  systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

- **Protector**
  A **protector** is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
  from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.

- **Quoigenic** Quoigenic is an origin term that means the user does not want 
  to share their origins, does not think it's relevant, or thinks it's 
  the wrong question to ask.  It's derived from the French word "quoi", 
  which approximately means "what".

- **Role**
  A role is the position a member takes within their system.
  This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
  or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

- **Singlet** Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words 
  doesn't share their body with anyone else.  It's not a binary distinction, as 
  people may be questioning being plural, and median can be viewed as a 
  continuum with singlet at one end.

- **Switching** Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.
  This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
  something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
  The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.
  Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
  result in blend states in the in-between time.

- **System**
  A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
  that share a single physical plural body.
  The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
  different. 

  Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
  names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
  than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
  with adjectives applied.

- **System Exclusionist**
  A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
  about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
  'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
  apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. 

- **Traumagenic**
  Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
  more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
  fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.

- **Tulpamancy**
  Tulpamancy is the art of purposefully creating headmates through various 
  techniques. A headmate created in this way is called a "tulpa". 
  A tulpamancer is a practitioner of tulpamancy.
  Parogenic is a related concept, but the term may be avoided by some systems 
  in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic. Similarly, 
  tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic may be avoided by some 
  systems in favor of parogenic.

       irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to 
       produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for Anti-Capitalist purposes 
       only.
       
    1. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions 
       and Limitations apply to Your use, this License does not apply, and You do not

       to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or 
       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to 
       exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to 
       circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, 
       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(A)(4) never produces 
       Adapted Material.
       
    1. Downstream recipients.

       a. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the 
          Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise 
          the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this License.

          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).
       
A.  Other rights.

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a 
       collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
       licensing scheme. 


### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following 
conditions.

A.  Attribution.

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

       a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed 
          Material:

          i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any 
             others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by 
             the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

          i. a copyright notice;

          i. a notice that refers to this License;

             practicable;

       a. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication 
          of any previous modifications; and

       a. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this License, and 
          include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this License.

    1. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(A)(1) in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed 
       Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by 
       providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
       information.

    1. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information 
       required by Section 3(A)(1)(a) to the extent reasonably practicable.

A.  Cooperative

    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(A), if You Share Adapted Material 
    You produce, the following conditions also apply.

    1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be an Anti-Capitalist license and 
       conform to the specifications in Section 1(J) to the extent reasonably 
       practicable.

    1. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's 
       License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to 
Your use of the Licensed Material:

A.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(A)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
