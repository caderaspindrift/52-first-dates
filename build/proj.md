# 52 First Dates

A rules-light tabletop roleplaying game about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* 
You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session. More like a few, until all 
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop for the day.

## What You Need

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least 3 players, preferably 4 to 6
- Two decks of standard poker cards, they should have different backs
- A copy of the System Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- Several copies (see below for an exact number) of the Headmate Sheets
- Pencils
- *optional* extra paper for notetaking

The number of players determines the system size, and thus the number of
headmate sheets you'll need.

 Players       System Size
------------- ------------- 
 3 players     3 headmates
 4 players     6 headmates
 5 players    10 headmates
 6 players    15 headmates
 7 players    21 headmates
 8 players    28 headmates

## A System Introduction

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:

:::::::::::::: systemlist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- []{.spin} **Cadera Spindrift**, primary fronter and project coordinator (she/her)
- []{.dera} **Dera**, our analytical headmate and game mechanics wonk (she/her)
- []{.carline} **Carline Stone**, social justice druid and in-house sensitivity reader (she/her)
- []{.ora} **Aura**, flirty lesbian disaster (she/her)
- []{.val} **Valorie**, generally quiet protector (she/her)
- []{.fox} who doesn't speak or write except in emojis; not a fox (fae/him/it/them)

[No Fascists]{.sidehead .inclu}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 
[No, really, we mean it. This isn't for fascists.]{.carline}

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

## What is plurality?

The following section contains information about plurality that should be read
and understood by the players before playing []{.gamename}. It's adapted
from [MoreThanOne.info](https://morethanone.info/).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: morethanone ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## More Than One: A Plural 101 {#more}

[Plurality (or multiplicity) is the existence of multiple self-aware entities 
inside one physical brain.]{.bigpara}

You could think of a plural collective as a group of lifelong roommates, but with a 
body instead of an apartment.

It's a concept that fascinates many, the idea of always sharing your life with others, 
never being alone no matter where you go. Yet, for all that, there's a lack of 
understanding and a great deal of stigma surrounding plurality, and many plurals 
hide as a result.

### Terms {#more-terms}

[There are many terms related to plurality. These are only the most common ones.]{.bigpara}

Different plurals have different preferences when it comes to language. Treat this list just as a 
starting point.

**System** (or collective): The plural group that resides within a single brain.

**Fronting:** When an individual controls the collective's shared physical body, sometimes called the “front”.

**Headspace:** An internal landscape shared by a collective, and often where people go when they are not at front.

**Singlet:** Someone who is not plural. One being in one brain.

**Switching:** When collective members exchange control over the front.

### Causes {#more-causes}

[It is not fully known what causes plurality, and it is likely there is not a single cause.]{.bigpara}

The clinical diagnoses of Dissociative Identity Disorder and Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 
are typically believed to originate from severe childhood trauma.

Outside clinical psychology, some plurals attribute their plurality to non-trauma causes. 
Some consider it a difference in their brain that they were born with. 
Others consider it a spiritual phenomenon.

There are even plurals who were not originally plural, but who became plural when their 
mental creations came to life, accidentally or intentionally.

There are also plural collectives who do not know their 
origin, who have mixed origins, or who do not see origin as relevant at all.

There are differences in functioning between the various plural origin types. 
For example, trauma plurals tend to experience more issues with memory and 
numerous PTSD-related difficulties that many non-trauma plurals do not.

However, they all share the common thread of being more than one.

### Myths {#more-myths}

#### Myth: Plurality is ultra-rare.

The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation places the 
prevalence of DID at approximately 1 to 3% worldwide. This is in the same scope as 
autism or OCD. The number is only higher once you add in OSDD plurals and plurals 
who do not identify within clinical terms.

While plurals are certainly not a majority, it is highly likely you've encountered 
at least one over the course of your life without realizing it!

#### Myth: Plurals are dangerous.

This particular myth is likely due to Hollywood's many portrayals of DID plurals as 
violent axe-murderers. To say the least, don't believe everything you see on the big screen.

According to 
[a statement released by the ISSTD](https://news.isst-d.org/isstd-statement-on-the-movie-split/), 
recent research finds no 
correlation between having DID and committing crimes. Those with DID are much 
more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators.

Sadly, most violence done by DID plurals is towards themselves. Over 70% of those 
with DID have attempted suicide at least once, due to (among other things) the 
weight of past trauma, comorbid health issues, lack of access to competent and 
compassionate healthcare, and frequent retraumatization from social stigma and ignorance.

There are no statistics released for plurals outside the clinical scope, but it is 
safe to say that they are unlikely to be violent either, no more than any other marginalized group.

#### Myth: Plurals are mentally ill and need to merge to become healthy.

While it was once commonly believed in psychiatry that plurality was inherently 
disordered, modern treatment guidelines now acknowledge that it is possible to live 
successfully and happily as a plural. Informed therapy for DID now focuses more upon 
resolving past trauma and teaching collectives to work together, with 
integration (the formal term for merging) optional.

Even after learning cooperation and working through past trauma, some plurals still 
find being plural difficult and opt for integration. Others can't even fathom the thought, 
and view the concept with great uneasiness. Still others may partially integrate, 
while others may attempt integration, only to find that singlethood either isn't 
possible for them or only makes things more difficult.

Just as with everything else, integration is personal for every plural. The decision 
to integrate or to remain plural can only be made by them, and them alone.

#### Myth: Plurality is all made-up.

[Brain imaging studies](http://didiva.com/about-did/fmri-studies/) have been conducted 
on DID plurals that have shown significant 
differences between collective members, differences that were not present in trained 
actors who were pretending to have DID.

There have been no such studies done on non-clinical plurality yet, but interest has 
been growing in the field.

#### Myth: Plurality is a miserable state of being / a gift with no downsides.

Plurality is neither inherently better or worse than singlethood (one entity in one body). 
Some plurals are happy being plural, some are unhappy, and others are in-between.

Never being alone can be a blessing. It can also be a curse. You can be super close to 
your roommates, or you might fight a lot, or you might just get along. 
And sometimes you can have things going on that make having roommates easier or harder. 
Even the best of friends fight sometimes.

All of this is true for plural collectives as well. It can be challenging to make sure 
every member is heard and taken care of. It can also be rewarding, when everyone supports 
each other to achieve things they couldn't alone.

### What is it like? {#more-what}

[There are many ways to be plural, and many dimensions to living as plural.]{.bigpara}

This page only barely scratches the surface, and is not representative of all plurals. 
Don't be surprised if you meet a collective who hasn't been described here!

Just as with any other group of people, members within plural collectives vary in how and 
how well they get along with each other. Some coexist happily while others fight, 
but in all cases, they must learn how to communicate, compromise, and cooperate amongst
themselves. On top of the basics are various unique challenges related to sharing a body, 
such as managing outside time and relationships as a group. It is an experience with both 
its challenges and rewards.

#### Identity

Plural collectives vary greatly in how separate their members are. A collective might 
see themselves as one being made of many facets, or many people coinhabiting one head, 
or even somewhere in-between. Members may also vary greatly in how different their 
personalities are: there are collectives where the members are extremely similar in 
terms of beliefs and behaviors, and others where the members are as different as any 
group of people picked at random off the streets.

The subjective identities and self-images of collective members might not match 
their body. There are members who may be internally younger or older than their body's 
age, members who are of different genders, and even nonhuman members.

#### Communication

Communication between members is crucial to a collective's functioning. 
Establishing internal communication, in fact, is a major part of DID therapy.

Some collectives are able to communicate with each other relatively easily, 
simply by thinking what they want to say at each other, like internal telepathy. 
In many cases, they are able to send raw thoughts and feelings to each other 
in addition to words, making communication somewhat easier (but not infallible).

There are some collectives who cannot communicate mentally at all, and instead 
communicate by leaving each other notes, keeping schedules and to-do lists, and 
writing in journals.

There are many collectives who fall somewhere in the middle, being only able to 
communicate through vague impressions. There are also cases where some members of a 
collective will be able to communicate easily, while others will have much more difficulty.

Even in collectives who can communicate reliably, communication can be disrupted by 
life stress, improper medication, or other factors, and so many groups have 
contingency measures for if this happens.

#### Headspace
Internal worlds vary greatly in terms of scope and function. Some headspaces 
are extremely simple, being nothing more than a single room or field where 
people can talk. Others are more elaborate: small villages, great mansions, 
sprawling forests. Still others are as complex as any fantasy writer's paracosm.

Some collectives do not have internal worlds at all. Instead, when someone is not 
actively fronting, they sit in the “backseat” or fall asleep.

#### Switching

Plural collectives vary in both the amount of switching they do, and the measure 
of control they have over it.

There are some collectives who never, or almost never switch. There is one member who 
stays at front, while the others stay in the headspace.

There are some collectives who switch constantly, handling their physical life in 
shifts of hours, days, or even weeks. Certain members may have specific jobs: 
for example, one member may attend school or work, while another handles chores at home, 
while another steps in only to handle dangerous situations.

For those groups who switch, there is a spectrum in terms of how much control 
groups have over their switching. Some may be able to switch almost at will, 
while others have almost no control. Many fall in between: switching can be 
controlled for the most part, but there are still conditions that will cause members to 
either involuntarily swap or get “stuck.” As with communication, both establishing a 
greater degree of control over switching and finding ways to manage involuntary 
switches are major parts of DID therapy.

#### Governance

There are many ways by which collectives govern themselves, laying down rules for 
everything from how to interact with people outside, to how to take care of their body, 
to how to treat each other.

Some collectives, especially smaller ones, are extremely informal about their governance. 
Like a group of roommates, they decide on some basic guidelines and ask each other when if in doubt.

Some collectives have a single individual, or group of individuals who are trusted to 
handle everything related to a collective's outer life. Others might have everyone vote 
on bigger decisions. Some expand this further, creating internal parliaments, and 
writing up formal charters.

Very few collectives run themselves without any rules at all — some degree of order, 
even if it's as simple as a shared agreement to harm none outside or inside, 
is vital to successfully living together.

### Etiquette {#more-etiquette}

[Every system has their own preferences on how they would like to be treated, but the 
following tend to be common rules of thumb.]{.bigpara}

Do not ask if they are dangerous. Hollywood is not a reliable source of information.

Don't ask to meet the “real” person. Everyone in a plural collective is real.

Don't assume that members of the collective have the same opinions, preferences, etc.

Do not out a collective without their permission, even if you think the person 
you are outing them to would be understanding.

Do not push them into therapy or medication against their will. If they haven't 
expressed any interest in integration, don't broach the topic with them. 
(Likewise, if they have decided to pursue care of their own volition, don't push them out of it.)

Do not pry into their trauma history, if applicable. (This includes asking if they have one.)

Remember that a plural collective is a group of beings. Many appreciate it greatly when 
outsiders refer to individual members with their individual names and pronouns. 
(After all, it's awkward to refer to someone by their sibling's name.)

If you're not familiar with them as individuals, many plurals will have some preference on 
how to refer to them as a collective: usually with plural “they/them,” and with their group name. 
(You might think of this as referring to someone by their surname/family name.)

If in doubt, ask what they prefer, and follow their lead.

Essentially: respect their right to privacy and self-determination. Unless they've 
identified themselves otherwise, think of them as a group of roommates rather than as 
one person with multiple personalities. Or a troupe putting on a show of singlethood 
in order to make ends meet. Being invited backstage is a great act of trust — don't break it.

## Safety Tools {#safety}

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone.

To ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend the *TTRPG Safety Toolkit*,
which we've included below. You should not play []{.gamename} without using at least
one such tool in your game.

In addition, we specifically call out certain points in the rules that need special attention
from Game Guides and players. These are marked with an [alert symbol]{.cw}.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: tstoolkit ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### What are safety tools?

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or GM may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and GMs to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As a GM, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

### The toolkit

Different safety tools work better for different
people and games. Finding the ones that best suit
the needs of everyone at the table is important, and
should be facilitated through discussion at the start
of every new game or new group.

This guide provides summaries of some safety
tools and techniques (with the original designers’
permission) to add to your own toolkit. This
includes the **X-card system**, the **Script Change
RPG Toolbox**, the **Luxton Technique**, and more.
Sources and links are provided at the end of this
guide for the full original materials, and the toolkit is
regularly updated with new tools.

#### Before the Game Begins

##### Session 0

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

##### Lines and Veils

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the GM or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

##### Script Change Rating

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

##### Luxton Technique Discussion

In the **Luxton Technique**, have an open
discussion between everyone at the table
about potential trauma triggers. This is with the
understanding that it’s not possible to identify every
single possible trigger or trauma, and that there is
no social pressure to go into details or individual
justifications for a trigger.

#### During the Game

##### X, N, and O Cards

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

#### Script Change

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

##### Luxton Technique

With the **Luxton Technique**, when a participant
comes across triggering content in play, they can
choose to discuss it with the other people at the
table. 

The participant is given complete control
over that content, expressed as a need or want for
how play will continue. This can include in-game
directions for plot and characters, as well as out
of game needs such as breaks. 

After the need and
wants are expressed, everyone continues play to
accomodate the requests.

##### Open Door

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

##### Breaks

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

#### After the Game

##### Bleed

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and GM if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

##### Aftercare

Together as a group after the game, check-in with
everyone to see how they are feeling. This is an
open way for everyone to emotionally decompress,
talk through, and process the events of the session
in a safe environment.

Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of
self-care and remind them that their mental health
comes first.

##### Debriefing

Debriefing as a group is a great way to reflect on
the game, identify possible issues, highlight the
fun things to continue, and work through potential
bleed. Debriefing can happen right after the game
or in the days following the stream.

##### Stars and Wishes

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, an encounter created
by the GM, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between characters, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

##### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session

Similar to **stars and wishes**, Script Change
has **Highlight Reel** and **Wrap Session**. 

The **Highlight Reel** is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay, an
encounter created by the GM, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The **Wrap Session** is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.

## Appendix: A Plural Lexicon {#lexicon}

These are important terms about plural systems that you may to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: lexicon ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- **Amnesiac System**
  An amnesiac system is one with limited or no memory sharing. Headmates don't 
  remember the time while other headmates are fronting and may experience this 
  gap as time loss.

- **Blending**
  Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
  to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
  or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.

- **Blurian**
  Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
  significant amnesic barriers. This term is usually paired with other terms 
  to describe a system, and itself has no correlation to the identities 
  within the given system.

  Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
  contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
  members and memory sharing.

- **Co-Conscious** Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when 
  multiple headmates are active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in 
  that these headmates aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace 
  or otherwise experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

- **Co-Fronting**
  Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
  them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

- **Core**
  The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
  Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
  not plural.  The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or 
  memories of the pre-plural self.

- **Endogenic**
  Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
  traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
  opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
  even within the same system.

- **Fronting**
  Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
  take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
  This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
  communication.
  In some cases, it's possible for no one to be fronting, in which case 
  some type of default behavior takes over the body. This can surface in 
  multiple ways, such as becoming unresponsive.

- **Frontstuck**
  A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
  More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

- **Front Trigger**
  Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
  cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
  These can be both negative and positive.

- **Forced Fronting**
  Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
  in the system.
  This is not the same as frontstuck as the headmate is not unable to leave front; 
  they simply don't want to.

- **Headmate**
  A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
  They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
  partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

- **Headspace**
  A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
  members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.
  Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
  Singlets may have a headspace as well.

- **Host**
  A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
  activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.
  Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 
  In addition, some do not like the term "host", and choose to use alternatives; 
  specifically, outernaut.

- **Introject**
  Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
  identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
  system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
  seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

  The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
  every system. It should be checked first if a system is comfortable being 
  referred to as such or not.

- **Little**
  A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
  This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
  systems based on their body's age.

- **Main**
  The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
  main or central influences on the system. This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
  often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
  an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

- **Median**
  A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
  distinct or separate from each other. It can be considered being somewhere 
  between multiple and singlet.

  Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
  in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
  between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

  The entities which inhabit a median system are known as "aspects" or "facets". 
  Some median systems may identify as different archetypes. Despite being more 
  fluid and similar, median systems can be very diverse.

  Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
  system are distinct.

- **Memory Sharing**
  Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
  memories with others in the same system.
  This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. 
  Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.

- **Mixed Origin** Mixed origin refers to a system that has multiple different 
  system origins. This could be because their system formed from a combination of 
  factors, or that not all of their headmates are of the same origin.

- **Multiple**
  A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
  physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.
  The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
  system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

- **Parogenic**
  Parogenic refers to systems or headmates that were created using thought-based 
  or metaphysical means, usually deliberately.
  Tulpamancy is a related concept, but the term is avoided by some systems 
  due to its origins or other reasons. Similarly, parogenic may be avoided by 
  some systems in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic.

- **Partitionary**
  A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
  particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
  memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
  and resulting time loss.
  Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
  for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
  rest of the system or subsystem.

- **Persecutor**
  A **persecutor** is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
  body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
  Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
  and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
  abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 

- **Plurality**
  Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
  single body. Plural experiences are extremely diverse. 
  Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, median or partitionary, 
  small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

- **Pluralphobe**
  A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
  systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

- **Protector**
  A **protector** is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
  from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.

- **Quoigenic** Quoigenic is an origin term that means the user does not want 
  to share their origins, does not think it's relevant, or thinks it's 
  the wrong question to ask.  It's derived from the French word "quoi", 
  which approximately means "what".

- **Role**
  A role is the position a member takes within their system.
  This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
  or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

- **Singlet** Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words 
  doesn't share their body with anyone else.  It's not a binary distinction, as 
  people may be questioning being plural, and median can be viewed as a 
  continuum with singlet at one end.

- **Switching** Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.
  This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
  something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
  The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.
  Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
  result in blend states in the in-between time.

- **System**
  A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
  that share a single physical plural body.
  The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
  different. 

  Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
  names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
  than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
  with adjectives applied.

- **System Exclusionist**
  A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
  about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
  'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
  apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. 

- **Traumagenic**
  Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
  more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
  fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.

- **Tulpamancy**
  Tulpamancy is the art of purposefully creating headmates through various 
  techniques. A headmate created in this way is called a "tulpa". 
  A tulpamancer is a practitioner of tulpamancy.
  Parogenic is a related concept, but the term may be avoided by some systems 
  in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic. Similarly, 
  tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic may be avoided by some 
  systems in favor of parogenic.

    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
