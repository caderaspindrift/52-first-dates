# 52 First Dates

[]{.gamename} is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session (or even ever)!
More likely you'll just play out a few, either a pre-arranged number or until
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop.

## What You Need {.nobreak}

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least three players; preferably four to six, and usually no more than eight
- Two decks of standard poker cards; they should have different backs
- One copy of the System Sheet
- One copy of the Outside Interference Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- One Headmate Sheet per player
- One Game Reference Sheet per player
- Pencils
- *optional, but recommended* Extra paper for notetaking

## The Purpose of []{.gamename} {.nobreak}

This game attempts to do four things at once. It's up to you, the players, to determine
if it succeeds at any of those. The four goals are to be a game that:

1. Has multiple players playing the same character
2. Educates about plural systems
3. Functions as an interesting dating sim
4. Is actually fun to play

## Game Design Philosophy

Our take on indie game design[Dera totally wrote this section, she's so wordy]{.aura} 
is that of an ongoing conversation where a number of
different voices weave in and out with their contributions that answer the question,
"What *is* a roleplaying game? What *can* a roleplaying game *be*?"

All of our games are made with that in mind: this is our part in the conversation,
right here, right now. We may have more to add later, but this is what we want to say
now.

Very few concepts in the game are *completely* new. For example, card-based games 
have long been a part of the hobby, to varying degrees of success. Romance/dating 
sim tabletop RPGs aren't as common, but they're out there -- most notably by
[Emily Care Boss](http://www.blackgreengames.com/) in her
[*Romance Trilogy*](http://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf).
<a name="anchor-ecb"></a>

Games where many players run the same character are even more rare; and I don't
know of any that address it from the standpoint of a plural, shared character.
If you do, let me know!

But just as nobody invents all the words they speak, the magic isn't in the parts
you use but how you assemble them -- or even beyond that, in what you *actually*
say with those words.

Hopefully we'll be able to communicate our message to you as you play []{.gamename}!

## A System Introduction {#our-system .nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:

~    Primary (co-)fronter and project coordinator; she/her

Dera []{.emoji-dera}

[No Fascists]{.sidehead .inclu}

If you're a fascist, you're not welcome to play this game. It's against the rules. 
[No, really, we mean it. This isn't for fascists.]{.carline}

If you're reading this and thinking, "You just call everyone you disagree with a fascist," 
then you're probably a fascist, or incapable of drawing inferences from context and 
acknowledging a dangerous political climate that causes the oppressed to be hyperbolic. 

Don't play this game. Heal yourself. Grow. Learn. 
Watch some [Mister Roger's Neighborhood](https://www.misterrogers.org/) or something.

## Safety Tools {#safety}

::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Honest, open, and empathic communication is essential to playing safely.](art/spectrum/comfort.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Playing the []{.gamename} RPG should be enjoyable for everyone.

To help ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience, we recommend the 
*TTRPG Safety Toolkit*, which we've included below. You should *not* play []{.gamename} 
without using at least one such tool in your game.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: tstoolkit ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### What are safety tools? {#what-are-safety-tools}

Sometimes games have content or situations
where a player or GM may feel stressed out,
unsafe, or otherwise not having fun. Safety tools
are a way for players and GMs to communicate
and check-in before, during, and after a game in
order to make sure everyone is still having fun, and
to provide the right support when needed.

Communication, trust, and care
The key to safety tools is communication and
trust. There needs to be open and respectful
communication alongside a culture of trust for
these to work.

As a GM, player, or organizer, you can create
this culture by making it clear that the care and
well-being of everyone at the table comes before
the game or story. This can be done by actively
listening to everyone, offering accomodations and
safety tools, implementing actions when asked
while not prying (nobody owes you their trauma
as explanation), and actively checking in before,
during, and after a game.

### The toolkit {#the-toolkit}

Different safety tools work better for different
people and games. Finding the ones that best suit
the needs of everyone at the table is important, and
should be facilitated through discussion at the start
of every new game or new group.

This guide provides summaries of some safety
tools and techniques (with the original designers’
permission) to add to your own toolkit. This
includes the **X-card system**, the **Script Change
RPG Toolbox**, the **Luxton Technique**, and more.
Sources and links are provided at the end of this
guide for the full original materials, and the toolkit is
regularly updated with new tools.

#### Before the Game Begins {#toolkit-before}

##### Session 0 {#toolkit-session-0}

Session 0s are a great way to begin
communication, set expectations on the kind of
story and play, and introduce and discuss what
safety tools will be used at the table.

##### Lines and Veils {#toolkit-lines-veils}

**Lines and veils** are used to set boundaries
on content in a game. 

**Lines** are hard limits on
content, things that the GM or the players don’t
want to engage in. Setting up a line means that
content won’t show up in the game at all. 

**Veils** are
soft limits, things that are ok “behind a curtain” or
when they “cut-to-black.” Setting up a veil means
that the content might be in the game but not
spotlighted or described in great detail. 

**Lines and veils** can be adjusted as needed throughout the
game.

##### Script Change Rating {#toolkit-script-change-rating}

**Script Change** ratings are used to set tone and
boundaries for your game. Using film ratings (or
your own), you can outline what audience you’re
playing for (e.g. PG-13 vs R). 

The **rating** also
addresses what content players do want to see
as well as what they don’t want to see. Make sure
to balance and respect everyone’s do and don’t
wants. 

**Ratings** and do-and-don’t-want content can
be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

##### Luxton Technique Discussion {#toolkit-luxton-discussion}

In the **Luxton Technique**, have an open
discussion between everyone at the table
about potential trauma triggers. This is with the
understanding that it’s not possible to identify every
single possible trigger or trauma, and that there is
no social pressure to go into details or individual
justifications for a trigger.

#### During the Game {#toolkit-during}

##### X, N, and O Cards {#toolkit-xno-cards}

**X**, **N**, and **O cards** are check-in tools. They can be
used by tapping physical cards, typing the letter in
the chat function of the video conference software
or virtual tabletop you are using, or using hand
signals. Before the game begins, remind everyone
that they are available and how to use them.

The **X card** can be used at any point if a
participant is uncomfortable with the content
happening in-game. When the **X card** is used by
tapping the card or typing an **“X”** in the chat, the
group can change, rewind, or skip the content.

The **N card** can be used at any point if a participant
feels like they are headed towards an X. When the
**N card** is used by tapping the card or typing an
**“N”** in the chat, the group can change the content
or have the scene “fade to black.”

The **O card** can be used at any point if a
participant wants to continue with the content.
When the **O card** is used by tapping the card
or typing an **“O”** in the chat, the group is ok to
continue with the content. They can also regularly
be prompted by a **“O?”** asked out loud or in the
chat to check-in if everyone is still ok.

#### Script Change {#toolkit-script-change}

The **Script Change RPG Toolbox** is a collection
of tools that can be used to adjust play and
content. They can be used by tapping physical
cards, typing the letter in the chat function of the
video conference software or virtual tabletop you
are using, or using hand signals. Before the game
begins, remind your players that they are available
and how to use them.

[Rewind]{.icon .rewind} can be used when something
has happened in play that makes a participant
uncomfortable. When [Rewind]{.icon .rewind} is used by
tapping the card, typing the shorthand in the chat,
or stating it out loud (“I’d like to rewind...”), be clear
about what content is being adjusted, rewind to a
point before it happened, and play starts again.

[Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} can be used when a
participant would like to skip past uncomfortable
content or to the next part of the story for pacing.
When [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to fast forward...”), skip forward to
a new spot in the story that everyone agrees on.

[Pause]{.icon .pause} can be used when things are too
intense, but you still want to continue playing the
scene. When [Pause]{.icon .pause} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“I’d like to pause...”), you can take a break
and/or discuss the content as needed. After the
[Pause]{.icon .pause}, you can [Resume]{.icon .resume}, 
[Rewind]{.icon .rewind}, [Fast Forward]{.icon .ff}.

[Resume]{.icon .resume} can be used when everyone is ready
to continue play, often after adjusting or discussing
content. When [Resume]{.icon .resume} is used by tapping the
card, typing the shorthand in the chat, or stating it
out loud (“Let’s resume...”), continue with play.

##### Luxton Technique {#toolkit-luxton-technique}

With the **Luxton Technique**, when a participant
comes across triggering content in play, they can
choose to discuss it with the other people at the
table. 

The participant is given complete control
over that content, expressed as a need or want for
how play will continue. This can include in-game
directions for plot and characters, as well as out
of game needs such as breaks. 

After the need and
wants are expressed, everyone continues play to
accomodate the requests.

##### Open Door {#toolkit-open-door}

The **Open Door** is the assurance that someone
can leave or take a break from the game for their
own safety and well-being without being judged.
State this at the beginning and periodically
throughout the game.

##### Breaks {#toolkit-breaks}

For games longer than 2 hours or games that have
intense content, having a short built-in break is
recommended to allow people to stay focused and
process. Allow for discussion, bio breaks, or any
other needs during this time.

#### After the Game {#toolkit-after}

##### Bleed {#toolkit-bleed}

Emotions and stress from the game can bleed over
into post-game life. This can affect the enjoyment
of the game, as well as out-of-game relationships
between players and GM if not worked through.

Being open and honest about where the game
begins and ends, and being conscious of which
feelings belong to the player and which are just
bleed, helps to mitigate the effects.

##### Aftercare {#toolkit-aftercare}

Together as a group after the game, check-in with
everyone to see how they are feeling. This is an
open way for everyone to emotionally decompress,
talk through, and process the events of the session
in a safe environment.

Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of
self-care and remind them that their mental health
comes first.

##### Debriefing {#toolkit-debriefing}

Debriefing as a group is a great way to reflect on
the game, identify possible issues, highlight the
fun things to continue, and work through potential
bleed. Debriefing can happen right after the game
or in the days following the stream.

##### Stars and Wishes {#toolkit-stars-wishes}

**Stars and wishes** are used to reflect on the
session and communicate feedback in a positive
and forward-facing way. At the end of the game, go
around and get everyone to state a star and wish.

**Stars** are things that the participants really enjoyed
and loved about the game. This could include a
particular moment of roleplay, an encounter created
by the GM, or anything else that stuck out as
something awesome during the game. 

**Wishes** are things that the participants would like to see
in future sessions. This could include particular
interactions between characters, potential story
moments and development, or anything else that
could make the game even better in the future.

##### Highlight Reel and Wrap Session {#toolkit-highlight-wrap}

Similar to **stars and wishes**, Script Change
has **Highlight Reel** and **Wrap Session**. 

The **Highlight Reel** is used to reflect on the session
and highlight moments participants enjoyed. At
the end of the game, go around and get everyone
to state highlight of the game for them. This
could include a particular moment of roleplay, an
encounter created by the GM, or anything else
that stuck out as something awesome during the
game. 

The **Wrap Session** is an opportunity for the
group to reflect on the session and discuss what
could be improved going forward. At the end of the
game, go around and open up discussion about
the game. This could include content participants
didn’t feel comfortable calling pause or rewind at
the time, or talking about emotional impacts and bleed.

There should be no social pressure to disclose
the details or trauma to justify why someone felt
uncomfortable or unsafe during the game, as long
as the discussion moves towards how to address
the issues going forward.

## More Than One: A Plural 101 {#more}

*The following section contains information about plurality that should be read
and understood by the players before playing []{.gamename}. It's adapted
from [MoreThanOne.info](https://morethanone.info/).*

[Plurality (or multiplicity) is the existence of multiple self-aware entities 
inside one physical brain.]{.bigpara}

You could think of a plural collective as a group of lifelong roommates, but with a 
body instead of an apartment.

It's a concept that fascinates many, the idea of always sharing your life with others, 
never being alone no matter where you go. Yet, for all that, there's a lack of 
understanding and a great deal of stigma surrounding plurality, and many plurals 
hide as a result.

### Terms {#more-terms}

[There are many terms related to plurality. These are only the most common ones.]{.bigpara}

Different plurals have different preferences when it comes to language. Treat this list just as a 
starting point.

**System** (or collective): The plural group that resides within a single brain.

**Fronting:** When an individual controls the collective's shared physical body, sometimes called the “front”.

**Headspace:** An internal landscape shared by a collective, and often where people go when they are not at front.

**Singlet:** Someone who is not plural. One being in one brain.

**Switching:** When collective members exchange control over the front.

### Causes {#more-causes}

[It is not fully known what causes plurality, and it is likely there is not a single cause.]{.bigpara}

The clinical diagnoses of Dissociative Identity Disorder and Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 
are typically believed to originate from severe childhood trauma.

Outside clinical psychology, some plurals attribute their plurality to non-trauma causes. 
Some consider it a difference in their brain that they were born with. 
Others consider it a spiritual phenomenon.

There are even plurals who were not originally plural, but who became plural when their 
mental creations came to life, accidentally or intentionally.

There are also plural collectives who do not know their 
origin, who have mixed origins, or who do not see origin as relevant at all.

There are differences in functioning between the various plural origin types. 
For example, trauma plurals tend to experience more issues with memory and 
numerous PTSD-related difficulties that many non-trauma plurals do not.

However, they all share the common thread of being more than one.

### Myths {#more-myths}

#### Myth: Plurality is ultra-rare.

The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation places the 
prevalence of DID at approximately 1 to 3% worldwide. This is in the same scope as 
autism or OCD. The number is only higher once you add in OSDD plurals and plurals 
who do not identify within clinical terms.

While plurals are certainly not a majority, it is highly likely you've encountered 
at least one over the course of your life without realizing it!

#### Myth: Plurals are dangerous.

This particular myth is likely due to Hollywood's many portrayals of DID plurals as 
violent axe-murderers. To say the least, don't believe everything you see on the big screen.

According to 
[a statement released by the ISSTD](https://news.isst-d.org/isstd-statement-on-the-movie-split/), 
recent research finds no 
correlation between having DID and committing crimes. Those with DID are much 
more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators.

Sadly, most violence done by DID plurals is towards themselves. Over 70% of those 
with DID have attempted suicide at least once, due to (among other things) the 
weight of past trauma, comorbid health issues, lack of access to competent and 
compassionate healthcare, and frequent retraumatization from social stigma and ignorance.

There are no statistics released for plurals outside the clinical scope, but it is 
safe to say that they are unlikely to be violent either, no more than any other marginalized group.

::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::
![You can't tell if someone's plural just by looking at them. Is this one person or six?](art/spectrum/alone-bed.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Myth: Plurals are mentally ill and need to merge to become healthy.

While it was once commonly believed in psychiatry that plurality was inherently 
disordered, modern treatment guidelines now acknowledge that it is possible to live 
successfully and happily as a plural. Informed therapy for DID now focuses more upon 
resolving past trauma and teaching collectives to work together, with 
integration (the formal term for merging) optional.

Even after learning cooperation and working through past trauma, some plurals still 
find being plural difficult and opt for integration. Others can't even fathom the thought, 
and view the concept with great uneasiness. Still others may partially integrate, 
while others may attempt integration, only to find that singlethood either isn't 
possible for them or only makes things more difficult.

Just as with everything else, integration is personal for every plural. The decision 
to integrate or to remain plural can only be made by them, and them alone.

#### Myth: Plurality is all made-up.

[Brain imaging studies](http://didiva.com/about-did/fmri-studies/) have been conducted 
on DID plurals that have shown significant 
differences between collective members, differences that were not present in trained 
actors who were pretending to have DID.

There have been no such studies done on non-clinical plurality yet, but interest has 
been growing in the field.

#### Myth: Plurality is a miserable state of being / a gift with no downsides.

Plurality is neither inherently better or worse than singlethood (one entity in one body). 
Some plurals are happy being plural, some are unhappy, and others are in-between.

Never being alone can be a blessing. It can also be a curse. You can be super close to 
your roommates, or you might fight a lot, or you might just get along. 
And sometimes you can have things going on that make having roommates easier or harder. 
Even the best of friends fight sometimes.

All of this is true for plural collectives as well. It can be challenging to make sure 
every member is heard and taken care of. It can also be rewarding, when everyone supports 
each other to achieve things they couldn't alone.

### What is it like? {#more-what}

[There are many ways to be plural, and many dimensions to living as plural.]{.bigpara}

This page only barely scratches the surface, and is not representative of all plurals. 
Don't be surprised if you meet a collective who hasn't been described here!

Just as with any other group of people, members within plural collectives vary in how and 
how well they get along with each other. Some coexist happily while others fight, 
but in all cases, they must learn how to communicate, compromise, and cooperate amongst
themselves. On top of the basics are various unique challenges related to sharing a body, 
such as managing outside time and relationships as a group. It is an experience with both 
its challenges and rewards.

#### Identity

Plural collectives vary greatly in how separate their members are. A collective might 
see themselves as one being made of many facets, or many people coinhabiting one head, 
or even somewhere in-between. Members may also vary greatly in how different their 
personalities are: there are collectives where the members are extremely similar in 
terms of beliefs and behaviors, and others where the members are as different as any 
group of people picked at random off the streets.

The subjective identities and self-images of collective members might not match 
their body. There are members who may be internally younger or older than their body's 
age, members who are of different genders, and even nonhuman members.

#### Communication

Communication between members is crucial to a collective's functioning. 
Establishing internal communication, in fact, is a major part of DID therapy.

Some collectives are able to communicate with each other relatively easily, 
simply by thinking what they want to say at each other, like internal telepathy. 
In many cases, they are able to send raw thoughts and feelings to each other 
in addition to words, making communication somewhat easier (but not infallible).

There are some collectives who cannot communicate mentally at all, and instead 
communicate by leaving each other notes, keeping schedules and to-do lists, and 
writing in journals.

There are many collectives who fall somewhere in the middle, being only able to 
communicate through vague impressions. There are also cases where some members of a 
collective will be able to communicate easily, while others will have much more difficulty.

Even in collectives who can communicate reliably, communication can be disrupted by 
life stress, improper medication, or other factors, and so many groups have 
contingency measures for if this happens.

#### Headspace
Internal worlds vary greatly in terms of scope and function. Some headspaces 
are extremely simple, being nothing more than a single room or field where 
people can talk. Others are more elaborate: small villages, great mansions, 
sprawling forests. Still others are as complex as any fantasy writer's paracosm.

Some collectives do not have internal worlds at all. Instead, when someone is not 
actively fronting, they sit in the “backseat” or fall asleep.

#### Switching

Plural collectives vary in both the amount of switching they do, and the measure 
of control they have over it.

There are some collectives who never, or almost never switch. There is one member who 
stays at front, while the others stay in the headspace.

There are some collectives who switch constantly, handling their physical life in 
shifts of hours, days, or even weeks. Certain members may have specific jobs: 
for example, one member may attend school or work, while another handles chores at home, 
while another steps in only to handle dangerous situations.

For those groups who switch, there is a spectrum in terms of how much control 
groups have over their switching. Some may be able to switch almost at will, 
while others have almost no control. Many fall in between: switching can be 
controlled for the most part, but there are still conditions that will cause members to 
either involuntarily swap or get “stuck.” As with communication, both establishing a 
greater degree of control over switching and finding ways to manage involuntary 
switches are major parts of DID therapy.

#### Governance

There are many ways by which collectives govern themselves, laying down rules for 
everything from how to interact with people outside, to how to take care of their body, 
to how to treat each other.

Some collectives, especially smaller ones, are extremely informal about their governance. 
Like a group of roommates, they decide on some basic guidelines and ask each other when if in doubt.

Some collectives have a single individual, or group of individuals who are trusted to 
handle everything related to a collective's outer life. Others might have everyone vote 
on bigger decisions. Some expand this further, creating internal parliaments, and 
writing up formal charters.

Very few collectives run themselves without any rules at all — some degree of order, 
even if it's as simple as a shared agreement to harm none outside or inside, 
is vital to successfully living together.

### Etiquette {#more-etiquette}

[Every system has their own preferences on how they would like to be treated, but the 
following tend to be common rules of thumb.]{.bigpara}

Do not ask if they are dangerous. Hollywood is not a reliable source of information.

Don't ask to meet the “real” person. Everyone in a plural collective is real.

Don't assume that members of the collective have the same opinions, preferences, etc.

Do not out a collective without their permission, even if you think the person 
you are outing them to would be understanding.

Do not push them into therapy or medication against their will. If they haven't 
expressed any interest in integration, don't broach the topic with them. 
(Likewise, if they have decided to pursue care of their own volition, don't push them out of it.)

Do not pry into their trauma history, if applicable. (This includes asking if they have one.)

Remember that a plural collective is a group of beings. Many appreciate it greatly when 
outsiders refer to individual members with their individual names and pronouns. 
(After all, it's awkward to refer to someone by their sibling's name.)

If you're not familiar with them as individuals, many plurals will have some preference on 
how to refer to them as a collective: usually with plural “they/them,” and with their group name. 
(You might think of this as referring to someone by their surname/family name.)

If in doubt, ask what they prefer, and follow their lead.

Essentially: respect their right to privacy and self-determination. Unless they've 
identified themselves otherwise, think of them as a group of roommates rather than as 
one person with multiple personalities. Or a troupe putting on a show of singlethood 
in order to make ends meet. Being invited backstage is a great act of trust — don't break it.

## Glossary of Game Terms {#glossary}

Before we dive into game mechanics, these are the terms used in the game.

Player
~   This means what you think it means -- one of you who are reading this
    and, hopefully, playing the game at some point. There are no 
    gamemasters in this game, only players.

The System
~   A fictional character created by all the players and played jointly between
    all of them. This character is a plural system, and has been set up
    on a date by a friend.

Headmates
~   One of the members of the System's plural system. While there are as
    many headmates as there are players, a headmate is *not* tied to one
    player as "their" character.

Date Night
~   This is the actual event of the blind date between the System and the
    Date character. It doesn't have to take place at night; you can have
    it happen at any time. 
    When Date Night occurs, the Prospect character is created (or carries over
    from a previous date), and the roles are assigned.

The Prospect
~   For any given Date Night, this is the fictional character the System
    has been set up with for a blind date. The Prospect has their own desires
    and personality, separate from those of the System.

Roles
~   For Date Night, there are three roles: **The Date**, **The Fronters**,
    and **The Outside Interference**. These change between dates, and may
    change during a date as well. Roles are determined randomly at the
    start of Date Night.

The Date
~   The player who is currently controlling the fictional actions of the
    Prospect character, playing their cards to help describe how the
    Prospect acts toward, and reacts to, the System.

The Fronter(s)
~   The player or players (for a game with 4+ players) who are actively
    controlling the System by playing cards. With more than one Fronter,
    they alternate turns between each other. The Fronters roleplay the
    System as whichever Headmate is fronting at the time, which can
    change during the game.

The Outside Interference
~   The player who is controlling "the rest of the world", and introducing
    elements into the fictional Date Night to complicate the potential
    love connection between the System character and the Date character.

The Date Deck
~   The deck of cards from which both the Date and the Outside Interference
    draw their cards.

The System Deck
~   The deck of cards from which all the Fronters draw their cards. It's
    a good idea to a System Deck with a different card back than the 
    Date Deck, as the two will get mixed together frequently.

The Date Status Stacks
~   A row of three cards, situated between the players, upon which they
    play their cards. Only the top card matters, so the Status Stacks
    don't need to be laid out like solitaire game -- just as three 
    distinct piles.

End of the Date
~   When all of the cards on the Status Stack show the same suit or the
    same rank, it's time to wrap up that Date Night. The cards determine
    if the System and the Date share an intimate moment, want to date
    again, both, or neither.

Achieving Intimacy
~   One of the two main outcomes of Date Night. "Intimacy" is a deliberately
    broad term, allowing this to include everything from physical sex to
    a long night talking about feelings, at the option of the players.

Getting a Second Date
~   The other main outcome of Date Night. The Prospect character is willing to
    see the System again, and the players collectively can decide if they'd
    like to do that, or go on a date with someone else.

Aftercare
~   This is another broad term, adapted from the TTRPG Safety Toolkit.
    It's a recognition that even dating vicariously through a fictional
    character can stir up emotions, and players may need time to process
    those.


## Using the Cards {#game}

:::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Instead of dice like many tabletop roleplaying games, 52 First Dates uses playing cards.](art/spectrum/group-cards.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You need to have two decks of cards to play []{.gamename}.

One deck is called the ***Date's Deck*** and is shared between the players
in the roles of the Date and the Outside Interference.

The other deck is called the ***System's Deck*** and is shared between players
in the role of the System.

At the beginning of each Date Night, shuffle each deck and then lay out a row of
three cards on the table, from the top of the Date's Deck.
These are known as the ***Date Status stacks***. 
During the course of the date,
you'll play cards from your hand onto one of the stacks.
[The two decks will end up mixed together, which is why we recommend that
you use two decks with different backs -- it's easier to sort out after the
date!]{.spin}

### Your Hand {#your-hand}

Each player, no matter which role they're playing, has a hand of five cards.
The hands of the Date and the Outside Interference are drawn from the top
of the Date's Deck, while the other players' hands are drawn from the
System's Deck.

After you play a card, draw another card from the appropriate deck.

### Matching Cards {#game-matching .breakbefore}

Two cards **match suits** if their suits are the same -- such as clubs
or diamonds.

These cards match suits:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[7 of Spades]{.card .s .seven}
[King of Spades]{.card .s .king}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Two cards *match colors* if their suits are the same color -- black or red.
[]{.clubs} Clubs and []{.spades} spades are black suits, and
[]{.diamonds} diamonds and []{.hearts} hearts are red suits.

These cards match colors:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Ace of Clubs]{.card .c .ace}
[Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Two cards ***match ranks*** if their ranks are the same number or word,
such as Ace, 2, or Queen.

These cards match ranks:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .c .nine}
[Nine of Diamonds]{.card .d .nine}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These cards don't match each other at all:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Two of Diamonds]{.card .d .deuce}
[Queen of Spades]{.card .s .queen}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Choosing a Player {#game-choosing}

When you need to choose a player, such determining which role someone will
play in a date, all players turn over a card from the top of Date's Deck.
The player with the highest-ranked card is the one chosen.

To break a tie, players tied for the highest rank card draw a second card 
from the top of System's Deck.


### Roles and Cards {#game-roles .breakbefore}

Each role has different rules for drawing and playing cards.

#### The Fronters

If you're one of the Fronters, you draw your cards from the *System's Deck*. You can
play a given card on a Status Stack only if the card ***matches***
either the suit or rank of the top card on that stack.

You play one card per turn, when your turn comes up in the turn order. 
In games with more than three players, at least two players will share the System 
role, and you alternate turns.

For example, if the Status Stacks look like this ...

::::::: cardstacks :::::::::
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten}
[Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three}
[Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

... and you have these cards in your hand...

:::::: cardhand :::::::::
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}
[Five of Spades]{.card .s .five}
[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

...you could play your cards on these stacks:
[You can't play the <span class="card c five"></span> at all, since it doesn't
match either the suit or the rank of a stack.]{.dera}

:::::::::::::::: cardmatrix :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                                    [Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten} [Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three} [Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
---                                 ---                              ---                                  ----
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}       **yes** (rank matches)           *no*                                 *no*   
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}  *no*                             **yes** (rank matches)               *no*   
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}     *no*                             *no*                                 *no*   
[Five of Spades]{.card .s .five}    *no*                             *no*                                 **yes** (suit matches)
[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}  **yes** (suit matches)           **yes** (suit matches)               **yes** (rank matches)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### The Date {.breakbefore}

If you're the Date, you draw your cards from the *Date's Deck*. You can
play a given card on a Status Stack only if the card ***does not***
match the suit or rank of the top card on that stack. This is the opposite
of the rules for the Fronter role.

You play one card per turn, when your turn comes up in the turn order. 
In games with more than three players, you will be taking turns more
frequently than the players in the System role.

For example, if the Status Stacks look like this ...

::::::: cardstacks :::::::::
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten}
[Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three}
[Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

... and you have these cards in your hand...

:::::: cardhand :::::::::
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}
[Five of Spades]{.card .s .five}
[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

...you could play your cards on these stacks:
[You can't play the <span class="card d jack"></span> at all, because it
matches either the suit or the rank of the card on each stack.]{.dera}

:::::::::::::::: cardmatrix :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                                    [Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten} [Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three} [Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
---                                 ---                              ---                                  ----
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}       *no* (rank matches)              **yes**                              **yes**
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}  **yes**                          *no* (rank matches)                  **yes**
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}     **yes**                          **yes**                              **yes**
[Five of Spades]{.card .s .five}    **yes**                          **yes**                              *no* (suit matches)
[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}  *no* (suit matches)              *no* (suit matches)                  *no* (rank matches)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### The Outside Interference {.breakbefore}

If you're the Outside Interference, you draw your cards from the *Date's Deck*. 
You can play a given card on a Status Stack only if the card's 
***rank matches the last card played***.

You can play a card **immediately after any other player** plays a card to a stack.
When you do, instead of providing dialog for a character, you introduce a 
complication into the scenario determined by the card you played.

For example, if the Status Stacks look like this, with the last-played card shown
in red ...

::::::: cardstacks :::::::::
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten .gray}
[Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three}
[Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack .gray}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

... and you have these cards in your hand...

:::::: cardhand :::::::::
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}
[Five of Spades]{.card .s .five}
[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

...you could play your cards on these stacks:
[It's entirely likely that you can't play a card every time you potentially could -- 
that's by design.  The Outside Interference has more opportunities to play cards 
than the other roles.]{.dera}

:::::::::::::::: cardmatrix :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                                    [Ten of Diamonds]{.card .d .ten} [Three of Diamonds]{.card .d .three} [Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
---                                 ---                              ---                                  ----
[Ten of Clubs]{.card .c .ten}       *no*                             *no*                                 *no*   
[Three of Hearts]{.card .h .three}  *no*                             **yes** (rank matches)               *no*   
[Four of Clubs]{.card .c .four}     *no*                             *no*                                 *no*

[Jack of Diamonds]{.card .d .jack}  *no*                             *no*                                 *no*                  

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Playing a Card {#game-card .breakbefore}

::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![You play cards onto the three Date Status stacks and describe what your character is saying or doing.](art/spectrum/tarot.jpg){.bottom}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When it's your turn, you can *play* a card by laying it on one of the three
Status Stacks.

Playing a card is tied to dialogue or action
taken by the character you're playing -- be it the System character or the 
Prospect character.
You can describe what your character says and does and then play a
card, or you can play the card first and then declare what happened.

The suit of each card determines the current demeanor of your character.
Each suit can be played in generally positive way, such as being *direct or clear*,
or a less positive way such as being *blunt and tactless*.  
The demeanors associated with each suit are shown in the following table.
[Try this as a mnemonic: <br/>
 **Spades:** sharp-witted<br/>
 **Hearts:** passionate<br/>
 **Clubs:** blunt<br/>
 **Diamonds:** sparkling]{.spin}

Suit                   Demeanor
------                 ------------------------- -------------------------
[]{.clubs} Clubs       Direct and clear, or      Blunt and tactless
[]{.diamonds} Diamonds Flirty and coy, or        Evasive and guarded
[]{.hearts} Hearts     Earnest and heartfelt, or Thoughtless and inconsiderate
[]{.spades} Spades     Clever and witty, or      Mocking and hurtful

You don't have to announce the exact demeanor you're using when you
play the card, but should try to make it clear in the words you use or the
way you describe the character's actions.

If you don't have a card of the given suit to play, then you can't take an
action using that demeanor. 
[*Tip!* You might want to choose the demeanor before you decide what to say,
based on the cards in your hand.]{.spin}
For example, if the player in the Date role has 
no []{.diamonds} Diamonds cards in their hand, then the Date character can't
act in a *flirty and coy, or evasive and guarded* manner.

#### You *Must* Play If You Can

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronterm** and you have at least one card 
you can play from your hand, you must play one of those cards on your turn.
[This could mean you might end the date even if you don't want to.]{.dera}
[That's how dating goes sometimes ... sigh]{.aura}

If you're the **Outside Interference**, you aren't required to play 
cards when you have the option to do so.

#### At a Loss for Words {#game-loss}

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronter** and you *can't* legally play
any cards from your hand onto the current stack, then your character is
**at a loss for words**. You can describe how that character is taken
aback.

If you're the **Outside Interference** and *another player* is at a
loss for words, then you can immediately play a card from your hand
on any of the cards on the Date Status stack -- not just the card
most recently played.

#### The Outside Interference

When you're playing the **Outside Interference**, you don't have a turn in
the turn order -- you can play one of your cards any time the rank
on that card matches **the last card played** by another player.

Instead of describing what one of the characters says, you describe an
event that happens to the two characters, throwing their date into
uncertain territory. 

The type of event is based on **the rank of the card you play**,
but you can decide the details of the event as you please.

#### Responding to Outside Interference {#game-respond}

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronter** and the player in the role of the
Outside Interference plays a card on a card you just played, you have the 
option to play a card in response, following your normal rules playing cards.

When that happens, you also get to describe how your character reacted 
to the event in a way that minimized the problem.

You ***aren't required*** to play a card in response to Outside
Interference; if you don't wish to, even if you have a card you
*could* play, tell the other players that you pass.

#### Drawing New Cards {#game-draw}

Normally, you get to draw a new card after you play one.
However, if the Outside Interference plays a card, neither you nor
the Outside Interference draw a replacement card until
after you've either responded or passed on responding.

#### Ending a Date

After someone plays a card onto one of the Status Stacks, they should
check to see if a date-ending condition has happened -- either all of the
**suits on the stack match**, or **all of the ranks match.**

When that happens, the date moves to the resolution phase.

These are examples of Status Stacks that end the date:

:::: cardstacks ::::
[]{.card .queen .h}
[]{.card .four .h}
[]{.card .ace .h}
::::::::::::::::::::

:::: cardstacks ::::::::
[]{.card .ten .s}
[]{.card .seven .s}
[]{.card .deuce .s}
::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::: cardstacks ::::::
[]{.card .six .c}
[]{.card .six .d}
[]{.card .six .h}

## Part 1: The Set-Up {#setup}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Nobody wants to have a panic attack just from playing a roleplaying game.](art/spectrum/panic.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that you know how the cards work, we're going to tell you how 
the game is set up.
["the set-up" has a double meaning, see, because not only is this section about
preparing the game, but the whole conceit of the game is that it's a blind
date that you were *set up* on]{.aura}

Before the first Date Night, you have to do the following:

- Go over basic safety procedures
- Decide on the setting and themes of the game

Before *each* Date Night, including the first, you need to:

- Create the Prospect
- Assign Roles
- Set the Scene


### Game Safely {#setup-safely}

Dating can be an emotional rollercoaster for most of us
[even those of us already in an ongoing relationship!]{.aura},
and when dealing with issues of attraction, gender, sexuality,
and desire, those emotions might come to the surface just
by playing a roleplaying game.

For that reason, we strongly recommend that you use some of the
tools in the TTRPG Safety Toolkit, which starts on [](#the-toolkit){.page}.

**Lines and Veils** (see [](#toolkit-lines-and-veils){.page}) are the
first place to start, by defining which things you don't want to see at
all in []{.gamename}, and which things you're okay with occuring -- but
only off-screen.

Some specific examples that you might to consider for lines or veils include:

- Sexual banter and innuendo
- References to explicit sex acts
- Queerphobia of any kind, including as outside interference
- Other forms of bigotry and oppression, such as ableism or racism
- Abusive relationships, either past or present
- Infidelity
- BDSM, kink, and fetishes
- "Negging" and other insults

The **Script Change Ratings** ([](#toolkit-script-change-rating){.page})
tool lets you rate the game in the same way movies, television shows, or
comic books are rated. You can use those to decide when to fast forward,
rewind, pause, or resume the date.

(Most people in the United States are familiar with 
[MPAA movie ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system), 
but they're a very coarse tool when looking at tabletop roleplaying scenarios.
(Many of the ratings rely on determining whether a parent should be present,
how is that supposed to work here?)
[Oh, I should add that <span class="gamename"></span> is not a game intended
for small children. Our assumption is that all participants are adults]{.carline}
The [television content advisory system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_pay_television_content_advisory_system)
isn't much better, parsing out "four uses of at least two expletives" in a way
that's unworkable for gaming and concerning itself with visual imagery.)

One of the most widespread safety tools in the tabletop RPG hobby is the 
**X Card** ([](#toolkit-xno-cards)) that players can use to signal when they
need something to stop. We also recommend the use of the **N and O cards**
as well, to stave off problems before they become an issue.

#### The Meaning of Intimacy {#setup-safely-intimacy}

One of the two primary outcomes in []{.gamename} -- and one of the presumed
goals of the protagonist System -- is to become intimate with another person.

The word "intimacy" was specifically chosen instead of the more crass "get laid"
not just because it sounds more high-falutin', but also because it's *not*
true that most people going on dates want *sex*.

It *is* fair to say that for the most part, people going on dates are hoping to
find someone with whom they feel enough of a conneciton that they can let down
their normal barriers and share who they are and what matters to them.

That's what we're labeling *intimacy* here. 

It could be any of these, or more:
[Or playing a roleplaying game together!
<span class="aura">only you would find that "intimate", Dera"</span>]{.dera}

- A wild night of kinky sex
- Opening up about a deep-seated trauma in your past
- Taking the Prospect home to meet your family
- Staying up late talking about everything and anything
- Binge-watching your favorite television show together
- Telling your Prospect about being a System

When you have the pre-game discussion about safety, especially lines and
veils, be sure to ask what kinds of intimacy the players are okay with
exploring, and which types they'd rather avoid.

The assumption in []{.gamename} is that Date Night ends long *before*
any actual intimacy occurs -- we're not expecting groups to play out either
sex scenes or deep conversations until dawn. But you might want to either
pull the veil a little sooner, or drop a line and not cross it, based on
some types of intimacy that might arise.

### Setting and Themes {#setup-setting .breakbefore}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::
!["Let's just meet over coffee?"](art/spectrum/coffee.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.gamename} is a game about people. Plural people, singlet people, and the
random people we bump into on on a date.

It's not a game about dragons, dungeons, wars, stars, lasers, spells, or anything
else like that.

At least ... it doesn't have to be.

Our default assumption is that []{.gamename} represents a contemporary Western setting,
somewhere in the first few decades of the 21st Century. The System character and 
the Prospect live in a relatively cosmopolitan city where queerness is accepted and
celebrated, and where inroads are being made against ableism and pluralphobia but aren't
quite there yet.

The two characters were set up on an arranged date by a mutual friend who, while not 
knowing the System is plural, has a basic understanding of the persona that they and
the Prospect present to the world.

You don't have to play it that way, though.

If your group agrees, you could change the setting. Maybe this isn't in 2021, but is
set in a future resemembling *Star Trek*'s 23rd and 24th Centuries. Or a darker,
*Bladerunner*-style future. Post-apocalypse mutated animals? Anime-infused cyberpunk?
Not actually the future, but *a long time ago, in galaxy far, far away...*?

Or maybe there *are* swords and sorcery. The characters could be meeting in a bar in
Waterdeep, got hooked up in Bright Moon between fights against the Horde, or are
graduates of rival magical academies (run by transphobes), set up by a mutual friend.

Maybe the friend isn't even a friend. A dating site serves the same role; or an
all-powerful computer in a grim cyberfuture, or an oracle in the mythic past.

You *certainly* don't have to place your game in North America, I hope that goes without
saying -- but I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that haphazardly choosing 
non-white cultures for "play" in games is rather, uh, colonialist.
[you can totally tell that Carline wrote this section ... well, I can at least]{.aura}

That said, it's also okay to stick to the default. It's easier and more comfortable
if you aren't trying to figure out what the high elf view of gender might be, or
whether Trills are inherently plural 
[I mean, Trills kind of *are* plural.]{.dera}
[...]{.aura}
[I HAPPEN TO HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT TRILLS, OKAY?]{.dera}
[...]{.aura}, 
or what-have-you. 

In addition to the setting, you can add on themes to the game, which usually means
there's something that one or more of you want to focus on with the characters.
Some possible themes include:

- Queer liberation
- A simple study date at college
- Healing after a bad relationship
- Date Night gets caught up in an unrelated heist movie and goes horribly wrong
- A sweet and tender night out
- Capitalism ruins everything

I'm not going to give you much more of a list than that, because I don't want to
restrict your own creativity. []{.gamename} may have been created by us, but it's
*your* game to play as you wish!

The important thing is communication amongst the players. Be open and honest about
what you think you might enjoy, what you're willing to try, and what you absolutely
don't want to happen. Use the heck out of the safety tools (see [](#the-toolkit"){.page}).
Be willing to experiment, but don't forget to take care of yourselves.

Most of all, go have fun!

#### The Prospect's Name {#setup-prospect-name}

You can quickly determine a name for the Prospect by drawing a single card from the
top of the Date's Deck, and comparing it to the following tables.

These names have been chosen to have few gender assumptions attached.

#### The Prospect's Pronouns {#setup-prospect-pronouns}

Once you have the name of the Propect, you'll need their pronouns.

Draw one card to determine their primary pronoun, and then draw a second
to determine another set of pronouns they also use. 
[Here's a mnemonic for these -- **S**pades starts with an "S", as does
"she/her"; **H**earts and "he/him" with an "H"; **C** for both Clubs and
*chart*. There's no "d" in they/them, though.]{.spin}

First Card Suit         Second Card Suit        Pronouns
---                     ---                     ---------
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.hearts   }   Hearts he/him
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.spades   }   Spades any pronouns
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.diamonds } Diamonds he/him + they/them
[]{.hearts   }   Hearts []{.clubs    }    Clubs he/him + chart <br/>
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.hearts   }   Hearts any pronouns
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.spades   }   Spades she/her
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.diamonds } Diamonds she/her + they/them
[]{.spades   }   Spades []{.clubs    }    Clubs she/her + chart <br/>
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.hearts   }   Hearts they/them + he/him
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.spades   }   Spades they/them + she/her
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.diamonds } Diamonds they/them
[]{.diamonds } Diamonds []{.clubs    }    Clubs theythem + chart <br/>
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.hearts   }   Hearts chart + he

[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.diamonds } Diamonds chart + they
[]{.clubs    }    Clubs []{.clubs    }    Clubs chart + chart

If the result above says "chart" (i.e., is Clubs) then check the card's
rank on the next table.

#### The Prospect's Traits {#setup-prospect-cards}

When you create the Prospect, draw two cards off the top of the Date's Deck and place them
face down, ***without looking at them***, to the side of the deck.

The person playing the role of the Date will look at them and use them as a guideline for
roleplaying the Prospect. In addition, the trait cards are used in the Wrap-Up phase to 
determine the outcome of Date Night.

#### Is This an Ideal Partner? {#setup-prospect-qualities}

During the Headmate creation part of the game, you wrote one quality that the
Headmate was looking for in an ideal partner.
Now it's time to see if the Prospect measures up to that ideal. Here's how you
do that.

- For each Headmate, the Date writes the Headmate's name and desired quality on a line on the Date Sheet.
- One player flips the top card from the System's Deck and the Date flips a card from the Date's Deck.
- If the cards **don't match at all,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality.
- If the cards **match color,** the Date marks a check on that line; the Prospect has that desired quality.
- If the cards **match suit,** the Date marks a plus (+); the Prospect has that quality in abundance!
- If the cards **match suit and rank,** the Date marks a star; the Prospect is a perfect match on that quality!
- If the cards **match rank but not suit or color,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality at all. The Date marks a minus (-) on that line.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here's an example. Let's say the Headmate's desired criteria is
"enjoys tabletop RPGs" -- so that they have someone to share their hobby with.

The player holding that sheet and the Date both flip cards; we'll keep the player's card
consistent, with a Two of []{.hearts} Hearts, and examine different draws by the
Date.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .nine .c}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this case, the cards don't match at all. The Date doesn't put any mark on that line.
The Prospect isn't into TTRPGs.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .ten .d}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards' colors match. The Date marks a checkmark in the box. The Prospect plays TTRPGs,
hooray!

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Seven of Hearts]{.card .seven .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The colors match, but more important, the suits also match. The Date puts a "+" on the
corresponding line. The Prospect not only plays roleplaying games, but really likes the hobby.
Maybe they're a gamemaster, or just a die-hard roleplayer?

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards exactly match, one from each deck. 
[There's a 1 in 52 chance of this happening, which is 1.92% of the time.]{.dera}
["Never tell me the odds."]{.aura}
[Han Solo is kind of a creep, though.]{.carline}
We can intrepret this as not only does the Prospect play tabletop RPGs as often as
the Headmate, *but also* their group is looking for a new player!
The Date player marks a star in the box. 

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Spades]{.card .deuce .s}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Uh oh. The ranks match, but the suits don't match either color or suit.

The Date marks a "-" in the box. Not only does the date not play tabletop roleplaying
games, but actively *dislikes* them. This could spell problems for that Headmate.

### Turn Order {#date-turn-order}

- **Date player plays a card**
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - Date draws a card
- **System player 1 plays a card**
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - System player one draws a card
- **Date player plays a card** *4+ players only*
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - Date draws a card
- **System player 2 plays a card** *4+ players only*
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - System player two draws a card
- **Date player plays a card** *5+ players only*
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - Date draws a card
- **System player 3 plays a card** *6+ players only*
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - System player three draws a card
- **Date player plays a card**
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - Date draws a card
- **System player 4 plays a card** *7+ players only*
  - Outside Opposition may play a card
  - System player three draws a card
- **Back to start**

During the Date Night part of the game, the Date character and the System 
character alternate turns back and forth.

If you have more than three players, two or more players will be sharing the
System character, and will take turns in alternating order.

The Outside Opposition player doesn't have a turn in the turn order, but can
act in response to cards played by the other players.

::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Text messages are a great way to interrupt the perfect date.](art/spectrum/phone-upset.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As the Outside Interference, your job is to introduce events that could make 
it harder for the parties on the date to make a love connection.

That said -- you're not the *enemy*; you aren't playing *against* the System and the
Prospect, just trying to make their Date Night more complicated.
[We talked about this during our playtests; we decided *against*
 calling this the "cock-blocker" role, even though at times it could 
 seem that way. It's the job of the Outside Interference to make Date
 Night *interesting*, and in fact, they might make it *more* likely for
 the System and Prospect to make a connection.]{.val}
[... also "cock-blocker" is sexist and genital-essentialist language.]{.carline}
[Yeah, that too.]{.val}

You can *only* play a card as long as the rank exactly matches the rank of a card played
by another player. You don't have a spot in the turn order, and it's possible that 
multiple turns can go by before you get a chance to play. That's okay -- you won't be
the Outside Interference forever, provided that your group plays out more than one Date Night.

Whenever you play a card, you get to describe the event that occurs, as determined by the
card's rank, as shown on the table on the following page.

In the table, "the character" refers to the character played by the person
whose card you just played on -- so the System and its current Headmate if 
played on one of the Fronters' cards, and the Prospect if played on the Date's
card.

If the card you play is a red card -- i.e. []{.hearts} Hearts or
[]{.diamonds} Diamonds -- then the additional details given above come
into play.

:::::::::::::::::::: {.outsidechart .breakbefore .breakable .text } ::::::::::::::::::

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rank       Outside Interference 
----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ace     **Happy to Be Here!** 
            The character picks one of the Headmates not currently
            fronting, who switches to the front and is indifferent 
            about the switch.
            [On a red card, they're pleased with this switch.]{.red}

     2      **Stay For the Atmosphere** 
            Some sort of environment problem occurs, usually related
            to one or more senses or the weather.
            [For example: it's too loud, there's a bad smell, it's 
            raining, and so on.]{.eg}

     3      **See You In the Fall** 
            Someone nearby has a physical accident that interrupts the
            date. It probably shouldn't be seriously injurious.
            [On a red card, it directly affects the character.]{.red} 
            [For example: someone trips and falls on the character or
            a lost frisbee lands on the character's lap.]{.eg}

     4      **Capitalism Ruins Everything** 
            The character has to deal with the horrors of a capitalist
            society. (If you're not playing a game set in a capitalist
            society, good for you -- and you'll need to come up with
            something else instead for this rank.)
            [For example: they're out of cash, their debit card was
            declined, they lost their wallet, or their employer calls.]{.eg}

     5      **Excuse Me...?** 
            A harmless interruption occurs at an inconvenient time,
            such as just when someone was about to present a heart-baring
            answer to a deep question. The interrupter means no harm, and
            isn't intending to ruin the date.
            [For example: a small child approaches and asks if they're
            married, the server at a restaurant comes to take their order,
            or the character gets an insistent text message from 
            their friend asking how the date's going.]{.eg}

     6      **Wardrobe Malfunction** 
            A clothing-related problem happens.
            [For example: the character realizes they misplaced their hat,
            someone's shoes are untied, there's a spot of soup on their
            tie, and so on.]{.eg}

     7      **Forget-Me-Nots** 
            Suddenly the character realizes they've forgotten something.
            The Outside Interference gets to decide exactly what that
            might be.
            [On a red card, they forgot something about their date.]{.red} 
            [For example: they forgot their date's name, they forgot to
            pay attention to the time and missed their bus, they lost the
            keys to their house or car.]{.eg}

     8      **Consuming Passions** 
            A problem related to food and drink arises.
            [For example: the proverbial fly in the soup, the server 
            drops off the wrong order, a drink spills, or their date is
            allergic to the dish they just ordered.]{.eg}

     9      **Circumstances Beyond Our Control** 
            nobody could have predicted 
            These are problems that can't be directly controlled by the
            parties on the date. Including natural disasters.
            [For example: the power goes out, there's a traffic jam
            blocking their route to the park, an earthquake strikes.]{.eg}

    10      **Anything But This** 
            The Outside Inteference picks one of the Headmates not
            current fronting, who switches to the front and is apathetic 
            about the switch.
            [On a red card, they're upset by this switch.]{.red}

   Jack     **Oh Shit, It's My Ex!** 
            Someone the character was previously involved with
            approaches the dating parties. This creates a named NPC; 
            see below for details.
            [On a red card, the ex and the character had a bad breakup]{.red}

   Queen    **"Why, Hel*lo* There** 
            A stranger takes an interest in the character and
            approaches the dating parties. This create a named NPC;
            see below for details.
            [On a red card, the stranger is attractive.]{.red}

   King     **What are *They* Doing Here?** 
            Someone the character knows approaches the dating parties
            and tries to start a conversation. This creates a named
            NPC; see below for details.
            [On a red card, it's someone the character can't stand]{.red}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After you've played a card, you describe the event that interrupts the
character of the player whose card you played on, substituting your
description for whatever they were about to say.

If that player can play a card on top of yours, they can do so, and if
so, they can describe how their response prevents the interruption.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Here's an example. Let's say that one of the Fronters just played the 
Two of []{.spades} Spades, and described a witty comment from the System.

But you play the Two of Hearts in response. According to the event table,
this means something "atmospheric" interfered. You say something like this:

"They just said this really clever pun, and that's great! But unfortunately ...
the noise at the restaurant suddenly increased as there's a child's party
at the next table and they're singing 'Happy Birthday'. 
The Prospect couldn't hear you."

The Fronter could then respond with another card from the same suit, if
they've got any []{.hearts} Hearts in their hand. If so, then they could
describe how they're getting around the party song obstacle -- perhaps
by leaning in closer.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::: {.sidebar       } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Should you end the date?]{.sidehead}

If you can play a card and it would result in the date ending --
all of the suits match or all of the ranks match -- you can certainly
do so! It might go down like this: 

"Someone's approaching the table -- oh, shit, it's your ex!" <br/>
"Hey, they're all []{.spades} Spades -- so the date ends, right?" <br/>
"You're right -- so we don't even need to play a card to respond." <br/>
"Yeah, so how about this -- we duck out the back, quickly, happy to be away from that person. Laughing, we realize that it's getting late anyway ... so now we go to the Wrap-Up phase." <br/>
"Sounds good!" 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::: {.sidebar .next } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Should you end the date? (continued)]{.sidehead}

The bigger question is "should you stop the *other* players from ending the date"?

Which you could probably do from time to time. If they've just played the
third []{.hearts} Hearts card, the date would normally end there, 
but if you can play on that new card and do so ... you'd be prolonging
the date.

Which you certainly can do! This is one of the perks of being the 
Outside Interference. And unless you and the other players are tired
of the date, you probably *should*. It'll make things more interesting.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After you play a card to a stack, turn that stack on its side to indicate 
that an event is going on. Like this:

:::::::::::::::: cardstacks ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Two   of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h .tapped}
[Three of Spades]{.card .three .s        }
[Five of Clubs  ]{.card .five  .c        }
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The event continues to influence the date as long as that card is still showing.
When another player plays a card to that stack, turn the stack back up; the
other player gets to describe why that event is no longer a factor.

**Exception:** If the fronting Headmate changes, don't rotate the stack.

::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Let's say that the Fronter couldn't counter the "Happy Birthday" card -- that
means the situation is ongoing. While it doesn't automatically interrupt 
future card plays, there's still this loud child's birthday party one booth
away.

On their next turn, the Date plays the Jack of []{.spades} Spades on that
stack, describing the Prospect making a joke about not wanting to intrude on
the festivities and recommending that they and the System move to the bar
for a drink. The Date then returns the stack to its upright position.

:::::::::::::::: cardstacks ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Jack of Spades]{.card .jack .s}
[Three of Spades]{.card .three .s        }
[Five of Clubs  ]{.card .five  .c        }
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Named NPCs {#date-npcs}

Many of the events assume that other people exist -- such as the serving staff if the date takes place in a 
restaurant. While you *can* give these people names, you don't *have* to.

However, if you play a *face card* -- meaning a Jack, Queen, or King -- then 
you **have to give that person a name,** and probably pronouns as well.

You're creating what's called a *named NPC* -- "NPC" is an abbreviation for "non-player character"; it's a
tabletop gaming term that means "anyone who isn't a player character." In our case, it means anyone who isn't
either part of the System or the Prospect.

Once you've come up with a name<span class="dera">
  If you can't come up with a name on short notice, 
  you can flip one card and use the table for 
  the Prospect's name on [](#setup-prospect-name){.page}.
</span>
and pronouns<span class="dera">
  Likewise, you can use the table for the Prospect's pronouns
  on [](#setup-prospect-pronouns){.page}, 
  or just flip a single card -- <br/> 
  [Spades]{.spades} for she/her,<br/>
  [Hearts]{.hearts} for he/him,<br/> and
  [Diamonds]{.diamonds} for they/them,<br/>
  [Clubs]{.clubs} for other pronouns.
</span>,
record those on the Outside Interference Sheet next to the exact card you played, 
and announce those to the other players.

As long as the card you played is active, the named NPC sticks around and interferes
with the System and Prospect. During this time, you should roleplay the NPC as a hindrance
preventing the others from having open communication. 

Once the card is no longer in play, the named NPC leaves -- you can decide exactly how
and narrate their exit accordingly!

Each kind of named NPC gives you a chance to get input from the other players that you
can use to shape how you roleplay.

Named NPCs can be risky. Most of the time when you play a card, it's okay to describe 
the event in an over-the-top manner, but named NPCs by implication have an emotional connection
to the characters. You should approach this carefully and check often with the
other players.

##### Oh, Shit, It's My Ex!

Whenever you play a Jack, someone from the character's past shows up -- someone who they
were involved with, presumably in a romantic and/or sexual sense.

If the Jack is a red card -- the Jack of Hearts or the Jack of Diamonds -- then it was a
bad breakup; otherwise, they're still on good terms.

After you announce the name and pronouns of the ex, ask each player:

> What does this person look like?

Then ask the player whose card you just 
played on these questions:
<span class="carline">
 Before you do, you should do a quick check with the other players to make sure
 they're okay with going forward -- if you're using the O card
 (see [](#toolkit-xno-cards){.page}) or Script Change 
 ([](#toolkit-script-change){.page}) safety tools, this is a good place to use
 them. You might also want to check after the question is answered, too, if the
 one or more of the players seems upset. It *can* be upsetting to have one's
 ex suddenly appear, even if it's just a game!
</span>

> Why did they break up? Whose fault was it?

##### Why, Hel*lo* There

When you play a Queen, someone in the scene takes an interest in one of the characters.
In most cases this is a stranger, although you can modify that based on the circumstances.

After you name the NPC and their pronouns, ask each of the other players:

> What does this person look like?

If you played a red Queen -- the Queen of Hearts or the Queen of Diamonds -- then the
named NPC is *attractive*. 
Ask the player whose card you just played on:

> What about this NPC is attractive to your character?

If it wasn't a red Queen, then ask the player:

> What makes this NPC unattractive to your character?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![If your date doesn't go well but you meet someone else you like -- be sure to get *their* number!](art/spectrum/phone.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

##### What are *They* Doing Here?

When you play a King, someone from the character's life shows up. This could be a friend,
a co-worker or boss, a relative, 
[*OH SHIT, IT'S MY MOM.*]{.aura}
someone from school, and so on.

If you played a red King -- the King of Hearts or the King of Diamonds -- then it's someone
who the character can't stand. Ask the player whose card you just played on:

> Why can't your character stand this NPC?

If it wasn't a red King, then ask the player:
[An example of a good answer is "well, because that would cause problems at the office."]{.spin}

> Why won't your character just politely ask them to leave?

#### Recurring NPCs {#date-recurring}

The reason you write down the named NPCs is that they might show up again on future Date
Nights!

If you're playing the Outside Interference and the NPC Roster already has a listing for
the card you played, that named NPC could show up instead, under the following 
circumstances:

1. **The character from the previous Date Night is present at this Date Night.** 
   In other words, if the ex was the System's ex, then that ex can reappear; but if
   it was the Prospect's ex, they'll only show up again if this is a subsequent date
   with the same Prospect.
   [If you really want, you can break this rule -- maybe the same person also dated
    nearly everyone the System goes out with! -- with the approval of the other
    players present.]{.spin}

2. **None of the players object to that named NPC reappearing.** If someone says
   they don't want to see a given NPC again, then that person doesn't show up.
   It's important to distinguish between a player just bemoaning the appearance of
   an NPC -- "oh no, not this guy again!" -- and a player genuinely objecting
   to the NPC re-entering the game.

If the named NPC doesn't reappear then just erase their name from the roster and
create a new one with the usual procedure.

#### I Just Met You and This Song is Ableist {#date-maybe}

So what happens if the named NPC is actually rather pleasant and got along well with
the System? Assuming that there's a chance to slip in a quick
"Here's my number, so call me maybe?",
[The title of that song is ableist.]{.carline}
[Oh c'mon Carline, you know it's a joke]{.aura}
[... an *ableist* joke.]{.carline}
[She's right, you know.]{.dera}
[wait, *who* is right?]{.aura}
[Not you.]{.dera}
[:p]{.aura}
the players could choose to have the named NPC be the next Prospect instead of making a
completely new one from scratch.

If that's the case, you can skip the name and pronouns part of the Prospect creation
process, but still match against the Headmates' ideal partner and draw two Trait Cards
for the Prospect.


## Part 3: The Wrap-Up {#wrap}

After a game session of []{.gamename}, it's very strongly recommended that you have a
wrap-up discussion. Some groups might want to do this after every date, to reflect and
talk about whatever issues arose.

:::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![It's all but required that you talk about this game once you finish it.](art/spectrum/conversation.jpg)

### Aftercare {#wrap-after}

In the TTRPG Safety Toolkit (on [](#toolkit-aftercare){.page}),
they describe *aftercare* as checking in with everyone to see how
they're feeling. As the authors of the Toolkit write,

> Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of self-care and
> remind them that their mental health comes first.

This is probably a good time to take a break, giving everyone time
to use the toilet, step outside, stretch their legs, or get a drink
of water.



### Going on Another Date {#wrap-next .breakbefore}

:::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.lorem}

[]{.lorem}

#### A New Prospect {#wrap-next-new}

[]{.lorem} 

#### The Second Date {#wrap-next-same}

[]{.lorem}

Despite the name of the game, it's entirely possible to get a second date 
in []{.gamename}!
If the Date didn't ghost you, and the players reach consensus on going out 
again, play a second date (amd all subsequent dates) with these changes: 

- **Switch Roles** Select a new player to play the Date role, from the
  players who didn't play the Date. Then select another player to play 
  the Outside Interference who hasn't played the Outside Interference
  in this game.

- **Keep the Date's Personality Cards** You don't have to remove them
  from the Date Deck, just note them down on the on the Second Date part
  of the Date Sheet. These serve as guidelines for roleplaying as the
  Date.

- **Draw Two More Personality Cards for the DAte** In a second date, you're 
  usually going to be past the initial awkwardness, and you can find out 
  there's more to your date than you original assumed.

- **Decide What Happened Between Dates** []{.lorem}

#### Going Steady {#wrap-next-steady}

[]{.lorem}

If the Date is up for a third date, then you are officially Going Steady.  
Unless the system (or its members) are lesbians -- in which case you're 
moving in together.

### Post-Game Discussion {#wrap-discuss .breakbefore}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Sometimes you just need a hug, you know?](art/spectrum/sit-embrace.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If none of you wish to sit around talking after the game,
you can obviously skip this part!
But if your group is interested in discussing what happened
in the game, here are some ideas for discussion topics:

- How did this compare to your own experience, if any, with dating?

- Did the fronting Headmate change during the course of Date Night?
  If so, how do you feel that changed the story?

- What did you think of the Prospect? Apart from what the System 
  members might want, would *you* date them?

- This game gives you less control over your characters than in most
  roleplaying games. Did you feel constrained your choices by the
  cards in your hand, and if so, how does feel compared to more
  traditional TTRPGs?

- Have you learned anything about being plural by playing this game,
  even if it's just learning new terminology?

- *Optional* If you're plural and feel like sharing
  [Nobody should be put on the spot to answer this!]{.carline}, 
  how does this game relate to your lived experience?
  In what ways is it similar and in what ways is it really different? 
  What part of your life wasn't accurately portrayed in the game?
  [We know that we took shortcuts in making 
  <span class="gamename"></span> for playability's sake.]{.carline}


### Wait, Am *I* Plural?  {#wrap-wait .breakbefore}

For some people, playing []{.gamename} might line up some dots in your life, and 
you might question whether not you might be plural yourself.
Before we go any further, we want to say something very important:

***This game was not designed for helping you discover if you're plural or not.***
We didn't design it that way.
[Among other reasons, we don't have the expertise to do so.]{.carline}
[]{.gamename} is a simulation that might give the players some empathy for what it's 
like being plural, and reading the game materials could educate you -- especially the 
[More Than One](#more) and [Plural Lexicon](#lexicon) sections. But it's just a handbook
for a game, not for being plural.

That said, if you want to investigate further, the [Plural Resources](#resources) 
appendix has a number of links that can help you learn more about the plural experience
and what it might mean in your life.<span class="carline">If this game does play a 
role in any way determining if you're plural -- or *not!* -- drop 
us [an email](mailto:caderaspindrift@gmail)!</span>


## Variants and Hacks {#variant}

This section presents alternate rules for playing []{.gamename} in different ways.

::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![There isn't a variant for using a ouija board to play 52 Second Dates ... yet.](art/spectrum/ouija.jpg){.bottom}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

(The lorem-ipsums here indicate that further work is needed to flesh out the rules
for these variants.)

### System to System {#variant-system}

One of the more interesting exercises would be playing this as a game of
two systems going on a date. We haven't tried it, and to be honest, it could
get somewhat overwhelming.

As both systems would be effectively protagonized by the game, the idea of
multiple dates with several people should probably be set aside -- under
these game mechanics, plural systems take considerably more time to create
than a one-off singlet character.

The exact size of each system, and how members of those systems are created
by the players, can get tricky. Part of the reason for the group creation
of headmates was to give all players a sense of investiture -- but that
might not work if you're simultaneously building two sets of headmates.

Ah, Aura wishes to jump in. I defer to her.
[that was Dera droning on and on by the way]{.aura}

So -- here's what I []{.emoji-aura} think! I think if there are two groups playing
[]{.gamename} at the same time, it would be really cute and awesome if
the groups came together and played out a date between the two systems!
[Hm. That *could* work.
<span class="aura">of course! I *am* pretty clever you know. as much as you are!</span>]{.dera}

And they *FELL IN LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE* ...

[]{.lorem}


### Singlet on Singlet Action {#variant-singlet}

You don't *have* to make this a game about plurality. It could just be a platform for
telling stories about singlet couples that fall in love.

It would probably work best as a three-player game.
In such a case, two of the players acts in both the Date and "Fronter" roles simultaneously,
while a third plays the Outside Interference.

The game *would* lose something in translation, because a key part of []{.gamename} is
about group creation of the main characters ... but if you're looking for a dating sim
and you haven't followed our [](#anchor-ecb){.page} advice to check out 
Emily Care Boss's *Romance Trilogy* -- it might work. Maybe!

[]{.lorem}

### Queerplatonic Relationships {#variant-platonic}

[]{.gamename} assumes that the date is meant to lead a potential to romantic and/or 
sexual relationship.

But what if it's just a story about friendship? 

This variant looks at using the same rules to show a budding friendship between a 
plural system and a singlet friend.

## Appendix: A Plural Lexicon {#lexicon}

These are important terms about plural systems that you may to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/).
As always, our own notes are included in the footnotes, marked by 
our identifying emoji ([](#our-system){.page}).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: lexicon ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Blending
~   Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
    to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
    or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.
    [Our own median system does this a lot; part of why we didn't recognize ourself
     as a system was because we blend from to the other and don't even notice that
     our fronter has changed]{.aura}

Blurian
~   Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
    significant amnesic barriers. 
    Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
    contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
    members and memory sharing.
    [For game purposes, we assume the protagonist System to be blurian.]{.dera}

Co-Conscious 
~   Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when 
    multiple headmates are active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in 
    that these headmates aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace 
    or otherwise experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

Co-Fronting
~   Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
    them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

Core
~   The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
    Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
    not plural.  The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or 
    memories of the pre-plural self.

Endogenic
~   Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
    traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
    opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
    even within the same system.

Fronting
~   Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
    take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
    This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
    communication.

Frontstuck
~   A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
    More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

Front Trigger
~   Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
    cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
    These can be both negative and positive.

Forced Fronting
~   Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
    in the system.
    This is not the same as frontstuck (c.f.) as the headmate is not unable to 
    leave front; they simply don't want to.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![These are just a handful of the terms used by plural people to describe our experiences. Different systems, or even different members of the same systems, might use different terminology.](art/spectrum/newspaper.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Headmate
~   A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
    They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
    partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

Headspace
~   A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
    members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.
    Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
    Singlets may have a headspace as well.
    [We don't have a headspace. We tried making one as a pirate ship, but that didn't
     work out.]{.dera}

Host
~   A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
    activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.
    Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 

Introject
~   Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
    identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
    system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
    seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

    The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
    every system. 

Little
~   A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
    This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
    systems based on their body's age.
    [We decided that having headmates who are littles actively participate in a
     dating sim game was ... not a great idea. So if the System has any littles
     in it, we consider them "offscreen" during the game.]{.carline}

Main
~   The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
    main or central influences on the system.
    [Spinny was our main before but we feel more comfortable now with a shared responsibility model]{.aura}
    This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
    often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
    an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

Median
~   A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
    distinct or separate from each other.
    [This is what we are! a median system]{.aura}
    It can be considered being somewhere 
    between multiple and singlet.

    Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
    in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
    between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

    Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
    system are distinct.

Memory Sharing
~   Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
    memories with others in the same system.
    This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. 
    Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.
    [For the sake of the game, we decided that the System's members all have
     shared memories.]{.dera}

Mixed Origin 
~   Mixed origin refers to a system that has multiple different 
    system origins. This could be because their system formed from a combination of 
    factors, or that not all of their headmates are of the same origin.

Multiple
~   A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
    physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.
    The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
    system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

Parogenic
~   Parogenic refers to systems or headmates that were created using thought-based 
    or metaphysical means, usually deliberately.
    Tulpamancy (c.f.) is a related concept, but the term is avoided by some systems 
    due to its origins or other reasons. 

Partitionary
~   A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
    particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
    memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
    and resulting time loss.
    Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
    for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
    rest of the system or subsystem.
    [The assumption for the *game* is that the System is not overly partitionary,
     so that players don't have to roleplay lack of memory and such.]{.dera}

Persecutor [We used to have a persecutor, but we worked some things out.]{.spin}
~   A persecutor is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
    body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
    Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
    and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
    abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 

Plurality
~   Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
    single body. Plural experiences are extremely diverse. 
    Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, median or partitionary, 
    small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

Pluralphobe
~   A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
    systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

Protector[Valorie is a protector in our system.]{.spin}
~   A protector is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
    from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.

Quoigenic 
~   Quoigenic is an origin term that means the user does not want 
    to share their origins, does not think it's relevant, or thinks it's 
    the wrong question to ask.  It's derived from the French word "quoi", 
    which approximately means "what".

Role[This isn't the same a "role" in the game sense.]{.dera}
~   A role is the position a member takes within their system.
    This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
    or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

Singlet 
~   Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words 
    doesn't share their body with anyone else.  It's not a binary distinction, as 
    people may be questioning being plural, and median can be viewed as a 
    continuum with singlet at one end.

Switching 
~   Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.
    This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
    something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
    The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.
    Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
    result in blend states in the in-between time.

System
~   A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
    that share a single physical plural body.
    The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
    different. 

    Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
    names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
    than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
    with adjectives applied.
    [Our system name is "The Spindrift Crew".]{.spin}

System Exclusionist[Don't be one of these. They suck.]{.val}
~   A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
    about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
    'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
    apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. 
    

Traumagenic
~   Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
    more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
    fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.

Tulpamancy
~   Tulpamancy is the art of purposefully creating headmates through various 
    techniques. A headmate created in this way is called a "tulpa". 
    A tulpamancer is a practitioner of tulpamancy.
    Parogenic (c.f.) is a related concept, but the term may be avoided by some systems 
    in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic.

       now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary 
       to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or 
       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to 
       exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to 
       circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this License, 
       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(A)(4) never produces 
       Adapted Material.
       
    1. Downstream recipients.

       a. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient 
          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor 
          to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of 
          the Adapter’s License You apply.

       a. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
          or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological 
          Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

    1. No endorsement. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be construed as 
       permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed 
       Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status 
       by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in 
       Section 3(A)(1)(a)(i).
       
A.  Other rights.

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this 
       License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; 
       however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to 
       allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
       
    1. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this License.

    1. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties 
       from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a

conditions.

A.  Attribution.

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

       a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed

       a. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication 
          of any previous modifications; and

       a. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this License, and 
          include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this License.

    1. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(A)(1) in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed 
       Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by 
       providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
       information.

    1. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information 
       required by Section 3(A)(1)(a) to the extent reasonably practicable.

A.  Cooperative

    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(A), if You Share Adapted Material 
    You produce, the following conditions also apply.

    1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be an Anti-Capitalist license and 
       conform to the specifications in Section 1(J) to the extent reasonably 
       practicable.

    1. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's 
       License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner 
       based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to 
Your use of the Licensed Material:

A.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(A)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
    database for Anti-Capitalist purposes only;
    
A.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is 
    Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(B); and
    
A.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(A) if You Share all or a 
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace 
    Your obligations under this License where the Licensed Rights include other 
    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

A.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and 
    makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed 
    Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without 
    limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular 
    purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the 
    presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where 
    disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer 
    may not apply to You.

A.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on 
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for 
    any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, 
    or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this License or use 
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the 
    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of 
    liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to 
    You.
    
A.  The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

A.  This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your 
    rights under this License terminate automatically.

A.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
    6(A), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    1. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(B) does not affect any right the 
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed 
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed 
    Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this License.

A.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

A.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

A.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
    conditions of this License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

A.  For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be 
    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
    Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this 
    License.

A.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed 
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall 
    be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of the 
    remaining terms and conditions.

A.  No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to comply 
    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

A.  Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation 
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or 
    You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
