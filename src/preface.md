# What You Need {.nobreak}

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least three players; preferably four to six, and usually no more than eight
- Two decks of standard poker cards; they should have different backs
- One copy of the System Sheet
- One copy of the Opportunity Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- One Headmate Sheet per player
- One Game Reference Sheet per player
- Pencils and erasers
- *optional, but recommended* Extra paper for notetaking

# The Purpose of []{.gamename} {.nobreak}

This game attempts to do four things at once. It's up to you, the players, to determine
if it succeeds at any of those. The four goals are to be a game that:

1. Has multiple players playing the same character
2. Educates about plural systems
3. Functions as an interesting dating sim
4. Is actually fun to play

# Game Design Philosophy {.nobreak}

Our take on indie game design
is that of an ongoing conversation where a number of
different voices weave in and out with their contributions that answer the question,
"What *is* a roleplaying game? What *can* a roleplaying game *be*?"

All of our games are made with that in mind: this is our part in the conversation,
right here, right now. We may have more to add later, but this is what we want to say
now.

Very few concepts in the game are *completely* new. For example, card-based games 
have long been a part of the hobby, to varying degrees of success. Romance/dating 
sim tabletop RPGs aren't as common, but they're out there -- most notably by
[Emily Care Boss](http://www.blackgreengames.com/) in her
[*Romance Trilogy*](http://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf).

Games where many players run the same character are even more rare; and I don't
know of any that address it from the standpoint of a plural, shared character.
If you do, let me know!

But just as nobody invents all the words they speak, the magic isn't in the parts
you use but how you assemble them -- or even beyond that, in what you *actually*
say with those words.

Hopefully we'll be able to communicate our message to you as you play []{.gamename}!

# A System Introduction {#our-system .nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:
