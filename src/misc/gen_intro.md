# Create-a-Prospect from []{.gamename}

[](https://spindriftgames.itch.io/52-first-dates){.gamename} 
is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

This is an excerpt from that game; specifically, the rules for randomly generating
a (singlet) date, called a Prospect, using a deck of playing cards.

There are three types of players for any given Date Night:

- **The Collective**, who jointly share the plural character called the System (comprised of the Headmates);
- **The Date**, who plays the singlet character called the Prospect;
- **Opportunity**, who introduce Opportunity Events to make the date a little less predicable.
