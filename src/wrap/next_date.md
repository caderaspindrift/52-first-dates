## The Second Date {#wrap-next-same}

[]{.lorem}

Despite the name of the game, it's entirely possible to get a second date 
in []{.gamename}!
If the Prospect didn't ghost you, and the players reach consensus on going out 
again, play a second date (amd all subsequent dates) with these changes: 

- **Keep the Prospects's Trait Cards** You don't have to remove them
  from the Date Deck, just note them down on the on the part
  of the Date Sheet. These serve as guidelines for roleplaying as the
  Prospect.

- **Draw Two More Trait Cards for the Prospect** In a second date, you're 
  usually going to be past the initial awkwardness, and you can find out 
  there's more to your Prospect than you original assumed.

- **Decide What Happened Between Dates** []{.lorem}

## Going Steady {#wrap-next-steady}

If the Date is up for a third date, then you are officially Going Steady.  
Unless the system (or some of its members) are lesbians -- in which case you're 
moving in together.
