## The Second Date {#wrap-next-same}

[]{.lorem}

Despite the name of the game, it's entirely possible to get a second date 
in []{.gamename}!
If the Date didn't ghost you, and the players reach consensus on going out 
again, play a second date (amd all subsequent dates) with these changes: 

- **Switch Roles** Select a new player to play the Date role, from the
  players who didn't play the Date. Then select another player to play 
  the Outside Interference who hasn't played the Outside Interference
  in this game.

- **Keep the Date's Personality Cards** You don't have to remove them
  from the Date Deck, just note them down on the on the Second Date part
  of the Date Sheet. These serve as guidelines for roleplaying as the
  Date.

- **Draw Two More Personality Cards for the DAte** In a second date, you're 
  usually going to be past the initial awkwardness, and you can find out 
  there's more to your date than you original assumed.

- **Decide What Happened Between Dates** []{.lorem}

## Going Steady {#wrap-next-steady}

[]{.lorem}

If the Date is up for a third date, then you are officially Going Steady.  
Unless the system (or its members) are lesbians -- in which case you're 
moving in together.
