# Wait, Am *I* Plural?  {#wrap-wait .breakbefore}

For some people, playing []{.gamename} might line up some dots in your life, and 
you might question whether not you might be plural yourself.
Before we go any further, we want to say something very important:

***This game was not designed for helping you discover if you're plural or not.***
We didn't design it that way.
[Among other reasons, we don't have the expertise to do so.]{.carline}
[]{.gamename} is a simulation that might give the players some empathy for what it's 
like being plural, and reading the game materials could educate you -- especially the 
[More Than One](#more) and [Plural Lexicon](#lexicon) sections. But it's just a handbook
for a game, not for being plural.

That said, if you want to investigate further, the [Plural Resources](#resources) 
appendix has a number of links that can help you learn more about the plural experience
and what it might mean in your life.<span class="carline">If this game does play a 
role in any way determining if you're plural -- or *not!* -- drop
