# Aftercare {#wrap-after}

In the TTRPG Safety Toolkit (on [](#toolkit-aftercare){.xref-page}),
they describe *aftercare* as checking in with everyone to see how
they're feeling. As the authors of the Toolkit write,

> Encourage everyone to practice their own forms of self-care and
> remind them that their mental health comes first.

This is probably a good time to take a break, giving everyone time
to use the toilet, step outside, stretch their legs, or get a drink
of water.
