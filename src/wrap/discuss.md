If none of you wish to sit around talking after the game,
you can obviously skip this part!
But if your group is interested in discussing what happened
in the game, here are some ideas for discussion topics:

- How did this compare to your own experience, if any, with dating?

- Did the fronting Headmate change during the course of Date Night?
  If so, how do you feel that changed the story?

- What did you think of the Prospect? Apart from what the System 
  members might want, would *you* date them?

- This game gives you less control over your characters than in most
  roleplaying games. Did you feel constrained your choices by the
  cards in your hand, and if so, how does feel compared to more
  traditional TTRPGs?

- Have you learned anything about being plural by playing this game,
  even if it's just learning new terminology?

- *Optional* If you're plural and feel like sharing
  [Nobody should be put on the spot to answer this!]{.carline}, 
  how does this game relate to your lived experience?
  In what ways is it similar and in what ways is it really different? 
  What part of your life wasn't accurately portrayed in the game?
