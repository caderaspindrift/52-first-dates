## Singlet on Singlet Action {#variant-singlet}

You don't *have* to make this a game about plurality. It could just be a platform for
telling stories about singlet couples that fall in love.

It would probably work best as a three-player game.
In such a case, two of the players acts in both the Date and Collective roles simultaneously,
while a third plays Opportunity.

The game *would* lose something in translation, because a key part of []{.gamename} is
about group creation of the main characters ... but if you're looking for a dating sim
and you haven't followed our [](#anchor-ecb){.page} advice to check out 
Emily Care Boss's *Romance Trilogy* -- it might work. Maybe!
