## System to System {#variant-system}

One of the more interesting exercises would be playing this as a game of
two systems going on a date. We haven't tried it, and to be honest, it could
get somewhat overwhelming.

As both systems would be effectively protagonized by the game, the idea of
multiple dates with several people should probably be set aside -- under
these game mechanics, plural systems take considerably more time to create
than a one-off singlet character.

The exact size of each system, and how members of those systems are created
by the players, can get tricky. Part of the reason for the group creation
of headmates was to give all players a sense of investiture -- but that
might not work if you're simultaneously building two sets of headmates.

Ah, Aura wishes to jump in. I defer to her.

So -- here's what I []{.emoji-ora} think! I think if there are two groups playing
[]{.gamename} at the same time, it would be really cute and awesome if
the groups came together and played out a date between the two systems!
[Hm. That *could* work.

And they *FELL IN LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE* ...
