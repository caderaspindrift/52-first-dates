These are important terms about plural systems that you need to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/)

## Plurality

Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
single body. A group of headmates is called a system. Plural experiences 
are extremely diverse. Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, 
median or partitionary, small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

Headmates are generally assumed to have their own unique personality. 
They often have their own names, pronouns, goals, and preferences.

Referring to the system they belong to is often done using plural pronouns 
like we, us, them, and they, although it is best to ask. They may want to 
be seen as an individual, a part of a whole, an accompaniment to the core 
or host, or any other state of selfhood. Plurality comes in many forms.

## Singlet

Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words doesn't share 
their body with anyone else.

It's not a binary distinction, as people may be questioning being plural, 
and median can be viewed as a continuum with singlet at one end.

## Headmate

A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

## Fronting

Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
communication.

In some cases, it's possible for no one to be fronting, in which case 
some type of default behavior takes over the body. This can surface in 
multiple ways, such as becoming unresponsive.

## Co-Fronting

Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

## Host

A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.

Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 
In addition, some do not like the term "host", and choose to use alternatives; 
specifically, outernaut.
## Fragment

A fragment is any headmate that usually does not possess full autonomy, 
sapience, or identity.

Fragments may come and go before fusing or growing in complexity. They may 
perform very specific roles, have little emotional range, or hold 
fractures of memory.

## Headspace

A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.

Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
Singlets may have a headspace as well.
