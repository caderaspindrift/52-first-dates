# Appendix: A Plural Lexicon {#lexicon}

These are important terms about plural systems that you may to understand in
order to play the game. These definitions are adapted from
[Pluralpedia, the collaborative plurality dictionary](https://pluralpedia.org/).
As always, our own notes are included in the footnotes, marked by 
our identifying emoji ([](#our-system){.page}).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: lexicon ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Blending
~   Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
    to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
    or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.
    [Our own median system does this a lot; part of why we didn't recognize ourself
     as a system was because we blend from to the other and don't even notice that
     our fronter has changed]{.ora}

Blurian
~   Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
    significant amnesic barriers. 
    Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
    contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
    members and memory sharing.
    [For game purposes, we assume the protagonist System to be blurian.]{.dera}

Co-Conscious 
~   Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when 
    multiple headmates are active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in 
    that these headmates aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace 
    or otherwise experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

Co-Fronting
~   Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
    them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

Core
~   The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
    Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
    not plural.  The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or 
    memories of the pre-plural self.

Endogenic
~   Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
    traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
    opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
    even within the same system.

Fronting
~   Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
    take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
    This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
    communication.

Frontstuck
~   A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
    More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

Front Trigger
~   Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
    cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
    These can be both negative and positive.

Forced Fronting
~   Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
    in the system.
    This is not the same as frontstuck (c.f.) as the headmate is not unable to 
    leave front; they simply don't want to.

Headmate
~   A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
    They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
    partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

Headspace
~   A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
    members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.
    Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
    Singlets may have a headspace as well.
    [We don't have a headspace. We tried making one as a pirate ship, but that didn't
     work out.]{.dera}

Host
~   A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
    activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.
    Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 

Introject
~   Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
    identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
    system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
    seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

    The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
    every system. 

Little
~   A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
    This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
    systems based on their body's age.
    [We decided that having headmates who are littles actively participate in a
     dating sim game was ... not a great idea. So if the System has any littles
     in it, we consider them "offscreen" during the game.]{.carline}

Main
~   The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
    main or central influences on the system.
    [Spinny was our main before but we feel more comfortable now with a shared responsibility model]{.ora}
    This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
    often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
    an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

![These are just a handful of the terms used by plural people to describe our experiences. Different systems, or even different members of the same systems, might use different terminology.](art/spectrum/newspaper.jpg)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Median
~   A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
    distinct or separate from each other.
    [This is what we are! a median system]{.ora}
    It can be considered being somewhere 
    between multiple and singlet.

    Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
    in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
    between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

    Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
    system are distinct.

Memory Sharing
~   Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
    memories with others in the same system.
    This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. 
    Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.
    [For the sake of the game, we decided that the System's members all have
     shared memories.]{.dera}

Mixed Origin 
~   Mixed origin refers to a system that has multiple different 
    system origins. This could be because their system formed from a combination of 
    factors, or that not all of their headmates are of the same origin.

Multiple
~   A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
    physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.
    The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
    system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

Parogenic
~   Parogenic refers to systems or headmates that were created using thought-based 
    or metaphysical means, usually deliberately.
    Tulpamancy (c.f.) is a related concept, but the term is avoided by some systems 
    due to its origins or other reasons. 

Partitionary
~   A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
    particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
    memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
    and resulting time loss.
    Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
    for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
    rest of the system or subsystem.
    [The assumption for the *game* is that the System is not overly partitionary,
     so that players don't have to roleplay lack of memory and such.]{.dera}

Persecutor [We used to have a persecutor, but we worked some things out.]{.spin}
~   A persecutor is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
    body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
    Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
    and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
    abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 

Plurality
~   Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
    single body. Plural experiences are extremely diverse. 
    Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, median or partitionary, 
    small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

Pluralphobe
~   A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
    systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

Protector[Valorie is a protector in our system.]{.spin}
~   A protector is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
    from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.

Quoigenic 
~   Quoigenic is an origin term that means the user does not want 
    to share their origins, does not think it's relevant, or thinks it's 
    the wrong question to ask.  It's derived from the French word "quoi", 
    which approximately means "what".

Role[This isn't the same a "role" in the game sense.]{.dera}
~   A role is the position a member takes within their system.
    This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
    or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

Singlet 
~   Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words 
    doesn't share their body with anyone else.  It's not a binary distinction, as 
    people may be questioning being plural, and median can be viewed as a 
    continuum with singlet at one end.

Switching 
~   Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.
    This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
    something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
    The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.
    Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
    result in blend states in the in-between time.

System
    A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
    that share a single physical plural body.
    The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
    different. 

    Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
    names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
    than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
    with adjectives applied.
    [Our system name is "The Spindrift Crew".]{.spin}

System Exclusionist[Don't be one of these. They suck.]{.val}
~   A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
    about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
    'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
    apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. 
    

Traumagenic
~   Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
    more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
    fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.

Tulpamancy
~   Tulpamancy is the art of purposefully creating headmates through various 
    techniques. A headmate created in this way is called a "tulpa". 
    A tulpamancer is a practitioner of tulpamancy.
    Parogenic (c.f.) is a related concept, but the term may be avoided by some systems 
    in favor of tulpamancy/tulpagenic or tuplamancy/tuplagenic.
