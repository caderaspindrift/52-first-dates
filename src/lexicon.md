## Plurality

Plurality is the state of having multiple headmates collectively sharing a 
single body. A group of headmates is called a system. Plural experiences 
are extremely diverse. Systems may be spiritual in nature or secular, 
median or partitionary, small systems or ones with thousands of headmates.

Headmates are generally assumed to have their own unique personality. 
They often have their own names, pronouns, goals, and preferences.

Referring to the system they belong to is often done using plural pronouns 
like we, us, them, and they, although it is best to ask. They may want to 
be seen as an individual, a part of a whole, an accompaniment to the core 
or host, or any other state of selfhood. Plurality comes in many forms.

## System

A system is the collection of people and entities, often called headmates, 
that share a single physical plural body.

The experiences of plural systems are very diverse, and every system is 
different. However, there are certain attributes that are common among systems.

- Systems often have a dedicated name, separate from the body's or members' 
  names. It's common for systems to have names that are more like titles 
  than given names, such as being named after flowers, or cosmic themes, 
  with adjectives applied.
- Members of systems may be co-conscious or not. Members may switch in and 
  out, or they might always be active.
- Systems might have a headspace, which is a place where members exist and 
  can interact. Systems that don't have this might still have internal communication.
- Members of systems might be able to share memories or emotions.

## Co-Conscious

Co-conscious (also called "co-aware") refers to when multiple headmates are 
active at once. This is distinct from co-fronting in that these headmates 
aren't necessarily fronting, they may be in headspace or otherwise 
experiencing the outside world such as through internal communication.

## Switching

Switching is when the current fronter(s) of the system changes.

This can vary between something that happens constantly, or by accident, to 
something that requires much effort or happens only once a day or once a week. 
The experience of what switching is like also varies between systems.

Switching can also take varying amounts of time, which can sometimes 
result in blend states in the in-between time.

## Memory Sharing

Memory sharing is a system function whereby headmates can share their own 
memories with others in the same system.

This may happen automatically or may require deliberate action by headmates. Not all systems have memory sharing and those that do may have it to varying degrees.
## Singlet

Singlet refers to a person who isn't plural, or in other words doesn't share 
their body with anyone else.

It's not a binary distinction, as people may be questioning being plural, 
and median can be viewed as a continuum with singlet at one end.

## Headmate

A headmate is a singular person or entity in a plural system or collective. 
They can be clearly separated (like in DID or OSDD-1b, called a multiple or 
partitionary system) or more blurry and fluid (like in median or OSDD-1a).

## Core

The core is a headmate with a direct connection to the body's pre-plural self. 
Not every system has one, and not every system had a point at which they were 
not plural.

The core often inherits the personality, identity, and/or memories of the 
pre-plural self.

## Fronting

Fronting is an activity performed by one or more headmates, where they 
take control of the body and handle daily activities and communication. 
This can often include allowing other headmates to speak via internal 
communication.

In some cases, it's possible for no one to be fronting, in which case 
some type of default behavior takes over the body. This can surface in 
multiple ways, such as becoming unresponsive.

## Co-Fronting

Co-fronting is when two or more headmates are fronting. This can result in 
them having to coordinate actions, or for their personalities to blend together.

## Host

A host is the headmate who is most active, most responsible for day-to-day 
activities, or otherwise is fronting most often.

Not all systems have hosts, and some may have a rotating team for the role. 
In addition, some do not like the term "host", and choose to use alternatives; 
specifically, outernaut.

## Headspace

A headspace (also known as inner world or wonderland) is a place that 
members of a system can visit or inhabit, where they can talk to other headmates.

Not every system has one, but many do. It is also not unique to systems. 
Singlets may have a headspace as well.

## Traumagenic

Traumagenic refers to a system whose creation/origin is the result of one or 
more traumatic events. Often, these systems have lingering trauma, and may 
fall under a diagnosis like DID or OSDD-1.

## Endogenic

Endogenic is an umbrella term that refers to all systems that are not completely 
traumagenic in origin, it encompasses many experiences. It is often seen as the 
opposite to the pathologized views of plurality, although can exist in harmony, 
even within the same system.

## Median

A median system (also called midcontinuum) is a system where members are not as 
distinct or separate from each other. It can be considered being somewhere 
between multiple and singlet.

Some are dependent on a single individual, or the dependence can be mutual 
in that there is no central individual. Some median systems feel more blurred 
between themselves. Others may also be based around a shared identity or kin.

The entities which inhabit a median system are known as "aspects" or "facets". 
Some median systems may identify as different archetypes. Despite being more 
fluid and similar, median systems can be very diverse.

Median is often used as opposed to multiple, where members in a multiple 
system are distinct.

## Multiple

A multiple system is the state of being more than one entity in one 
physical body where the identites of headmates are more distinct.

The term is sometimes used as opposed to median, where distinction between 
system members is less distinct than with a multiple system.

## Partitionary

A partitionary system is one where the divisions between headmates are 
particularly solidly defined. This may include other attributes, like lack of 
memory sharing, lack of internal communication, or lack of co-consciousness 
and resulting time loss.

Systems may become more or less partitionary over time. It is also possible 
for different headmates to have different levels of partitioning from the 
rest of the system or subsystem.

## Blurian

Blurian refers to easier or complete memory sharing, having a lack of 
significant amnesic barriers. This term is usually paired with other terms 
to describe a system, and itself has no correlation to the identities 
within the given system.

Blurian is usually paired up with the terms median or multiple, in 
contrast to partitionary, to indicate both the distinction of system 
members and memory sharing.

## Fragment

A fragment is any headmate that usually does not possess full autonomy, 
sapience, or identity.

Fragments may come and go before fusing or growing in complexity. They may 
perform very specific roles, have little emotional range, or hold 
fractures of memory.

## Introject

Introjects are headmates who have an original source that their personality, 
identity, and memories may be based partially or fully on. They can join a 
system for any number of reasons: having similar traumas to an individual, 
seeing strengths in the individual that the collective would benefit from, etc.

The term can be considered medical terminology and as such may not be used by 
every system. It should be checked first if a system is comfortable being 
referred to as such or not.

### Little

A little is a headmate that behaves or otherwise feels like they are a young age. 
This often approximately caps at age twelve, but may vary personally between 
systems based on their body's age.

### Role

A role is the position a member takes within their system.

This can be something with a specific focus such as a protector or a gatekeeper, 
or more of a general purpose such as a primary fronter.

Examples of roles include:

- Host 
- Protector
- Persecutor
- Trauma Holder
- Co-Host
- Main
- Companion

### Protector

A **protector** is a headmate whose role is to protect other members of the system 
from external harm, traumatic memories, harmful members of the system, or other threats.

### Persecutor

A **persecutor** is a headmate who acts harmfully towards other system members, the 
body, or to others. This is usually out of a misguided attempt to protect the system. 
Persecutors often hold internalized trauma and act in reaction to it, 
and the harm they cause may be unintentional. This can include aligning with 
abusers, engaging in self-harm or suicidal behaviors, abusing drugs, lashing out, etc. 

### Trauma Holder

A **trauma holder** is simply any headmate that holds significant trauma, often to 
keep others within the system safe from that knowledge. They are more common in 
traumagenic systems, but are not exclusive to any specific origin. 

### Gatekeeper

A gatekeeper is a headmate who controls switching, access to certain areas inside the 
headspace, or access to certain system members or memories.

In gateway systems, this can also refer to a headmate whose job it is to watch over 
new system members trying to enter the system and either welcome them or deny them access.

Some gatekeepers may be able to force switches.

### Archivist

An archivist is a headmate who is especially knowledgeable about events that 
happen to the system, both in the headspace and in the shared reality. They may 
also store and organize this information by using constructs in the headspace 
such as folders and files.

### Frontstuck

A headmate is frontstuck when they are in front and unable to leave.
More than one headmate may be stuck at once.

### Front Trigger

Front triggers are the people, places, things, ideas, and scenarios that may 
cause a system member to front or be drawn near the front.
These can be both negative and positive.

### Forced Fronting

Forced fronting is when one headmate takes front against the will of others 
in the system.

This is not the same as frontstuck as the headmate is not unable to leave front; 
they simply don't want to.

### Blending

Blending is when the boundary between headmates becomes blurred, and it can be hard 
to tell them apart, or even who is present. This can happen to the active fronters, 
or to anyone else who is co-conscious at the time.

### Amnesiac System

An amnesiac system is one with limited or no memory sharing. Headmates don't 
remember the time while other headmates are fronting and may experience this 
gap as time loss.

### Co-Host

A co-host is a headmate that shares the duties of day to day fronting with other 
members of the system. They may be secondary to a primary host, or equally share the 
role between multiple members.

### Main

The main is a headmate who is considered by the rest of the system to be one the 
main or central influences on the system. This doesn't necessarily mean they front 
often.  A main can be a leader, teacher, or another authoritative figure that has 
an influence over the system. They may also be someone that others draw energy from.

### Companion

A companion is a headmate who keeps the others in the system company.

### Pluralphobe

A pluralphobe is someone, typically a singlet, who actively seeks to remove 
systems and open plurality from their lives, for any number of reasons.

### System Exclusionist

A system exclusionist is an individual or system that holds strict beliefs 
about plurality and enforces those ideas on others, often in relation to causation. 
They often seek to exclude other kinds of systems from general plural spaces, 
believe other systems are faking or mistaken as to their own identity, or otherwise 
seek to exclude others from identifying as plural.

'Sysmed' or 'sysmedicalist' is a synonym that refers in particular to systems that 
apply outdated and misapplied medical ideas about plurality. Sysmeds prioritize 
DID and OSDD-1 experiences over others, and/or do not believe in endogenic systems. 
They often disparage "inclusive plural spaces", including saying that DID/OSDD-1 
systems don't belong within them.
