# Roles {#game-roles}

When you play out a date in []{.gamename}, each player takes on one of the
roles in the date. The three roles are
**The Date**, 
**The Outside Interference**, and
**The System**. 

Each role has different rules for drawing and playing cards.

## The Date

If you're the Date, you draw your cards from the *Date's Deck*. You can
play a given card on a Date Status stack only if the card *does not*
match the suit or rank of the top card on that stack.

For example, if you have these cards in your hand...

:::::: cardhand :::::::::
[]{.card .c .ten}
[]{.card .h .three}
[]{.card .c .four}
[]{.card .s .five}
[]{.card .d .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::


...and the Date Status stacks look like this ...

::::::: cardstacks :::::::::
[]{.card .d .ten}
[]{.card .d .three}
[]{.card .s .jack}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
