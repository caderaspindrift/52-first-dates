# The Cards {#game-decks}

You need to have two decks of cards to play []{.gamename}.

One deck is called the *Date's Deck* and is shared between the players
in the roles of the Date and the Outside Interference.

The other deck is called the *System's Deck* and is shared between players
in the role of the System.

At the beginning of each date, shuffle each deck and then lay out a row of
three cards on the table, from the top of the Date's Deck.

These are known as the *Date Status stacks*. During the course of the date,
you'll play cards from your hand onto one of the stacks.
[The two decks will end up mixed together, which is why we recommend that
you use two decks with different backs -- it's easier to sort out after the
date!]{.spin}

## Your Hand

Each player, no matter which role they're playing, has a hand of five cards.
The hands of the Date and the Outside Interference are drawn from the top
of the Date's Deck, while the other players' hands are drawn from the
System's Deck.

At the end of your turn, drawn enough cards from the appropriate until you
five cards in your hand again.
