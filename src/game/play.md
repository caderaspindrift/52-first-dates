# Playing a Card {#game-card}

When it's your turn, you can *play* a card by laying it on one of the three
Date Status stacks.

Playing a card is tied to dialogue or action
taken by the character you're playing -- be it the System or the Date.
You can describe what your character says and does and then play a
card, or you can play the card first and then declare what happened.

The suit of each card determines the current demeanor of your character.
Each suit can be played in generally positive way, such as being *direct or clear*,
or a less positive way such as being *blunt and tactless*.  
The demeanors associated with each suit are shown in the following table.

Suit                   Demeanor
------                 ------------------------- -------------------------
[]{.clubs} Clubs       Direct and clear, or      Blunt and tactless
[]{.diamonds} Diamonds Flirty and coy, or        Evasive and guarded
[]{.hearts} Hearts     Earnest and heartfelt, or Thoughtless and inconsiderate
[]{.spades} Spades     Clever and witty, or      Mocking and hurtful

You don't have to announce the exact demeanor you're using when you
play the card, but should try to make it clear in the words you use or the
way you describe the character's actions.

If you don't have a card of the given suit to play, then you can't take an
action using that demeanor. 
[*Tip!* You might want to choose the demeanor before you decide what to say,
based on the cards in your hand.]{.spin}
For example, if the player in the Date role has 
no []{.diamonds} Diamonds cards in their hand, then the Date character can't
act in a *flirty and coy, or evasive and guarded* manner.

## Ending a Date

After someone plays a card onto one of the Date Status stacks, they should
check to see if a date-ending condition has happened -- either all of the
suits on the stack match, or all of the ranks match.

A date ends when the cards match one of these:

- []{.clubs} []{.clubs} []{.clubs}                         
- []{.diamonds} []{.diamonds} []{.diamonds}
- []{.hearts} []{.hearts} []{.hearts}
- []{.spades} []{.spades} []{.spades}
- All of the same rank

## After Your Turn

When you finish taking your turn, you can draw enough cards until you have a
full hand of 5 cards.
