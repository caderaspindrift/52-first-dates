# Playing a Card {#game-card .breakbefore}

![You play cards onto the three Date Status stacks and describe what your character is saying or doing.](art/spectrum/tarot.jpg){.bottom}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When it's your turn, you can *play* a card by laying it on one of the three
Status Stacks.

Playing a card is tied to dialogue or action
taken by the character you're playing -- be it the System character or the 
Prospect character.
You can describe what your character says and does and then play a
card, or you can play the card first and then declare what happened.

The suit of each card determines the current demeanor of your character.
Each suit can be played in generally positive way, such as being *direct or clear*,
or a less positive way such as being *blunt and tactless*.  
The demeanors associated with each suit are shown in the following table.
[Try this as a mnemonic: <br/>
 Spades: sharp-witted<br/>
 Hearts: passionate<br/>
 Clubs: blunt<br/>
 Diamonds: sparkling]{.spin}

Suit                   Demeanor
------                 ------------------------- -------------------------
[]{.clubs} Clubs       Direct and clear, or      Blunt and tactless
[]{.diamonds} Diamonds Flirty and coy, or        Evasive and guarded
[]{.hearts} Hearts     Earnest and heartfelt, or Thoughtless and inconsiderate
[]{.spades} Spades     Clever and witty, or      Mocking and hurtful

You don't have to announce the exact demeanor you're using when you
play the card, but should try to make it clear in the words you use or the
way you describe the character's actions.

If you don't have a card of the given suit to play, then you can't take an
action using that demeanor. 
[*Tip!* You might want to choose the demeanor before you decide what to say,
based on the cards in your hand.]{.spin}
For example, if the player in the Date role has 
no []{.diamonds} Diamonds cards in their hand, then the Date character can't
act in a *flirty and coy, or evasive and guarded* manner.

## You *Must* Play If You Can

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronterm** and you have at least one card 
you can play from your hand, you must play one of those cards on your turn.
[This could mean you might end the date even if you don't want to.]{.dera}
[That's how dating goes sometimes ... sigh]{.ora}

If you're the **Outside Interference**, you aren't required to play 
cards when you have the option to do so.

## At a Loss for Words {#game-loss}

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronter** and you *can't* legally play
any cards from your hand onto the current stack, then your character is
**at a loss for words**. You can describe how that character is taken
aback.

If you're the **Outside Interference** and *another player* is at a
loss for words, then you can immediately play a card from your hand
on any of the cards on the Date Status stack -- not just the card
most recently played.

## The Outside Interference

When you're playing the **Outside Interference**, you don't have a turn in
the turn order -- you can play one of your cards any time the rank
on that card matches **the last card played** by another player.

Instead of describing what one of the characters says, you describe an
event that happens to the two characters, throwing their date into
uncertain territory. 

The type of event is based on **the rank of the card you play**,
but you can decide the details of the event as you please.

## Responding to Outside Interference {#game-respond}

If you're the **Date** or a **Fronter** and the player in the role of the
Outside Interference plays a card on a card you just played, you have the 
option to play a card in response, following your normal rules playing cards.

When that happens, you also get to describe how your character reacted 
to the event in a way that minimized the problem.

You ***aren't required*** to play a card in response to Outside
Interference; if you don't wish to, even if you have a card you
*could* play, tell the other players that you pass.

## Drawing New Cards {#game-draw}

Normally, you get to draw a new card after you play one.
However, if the Outside Interference plays a card, neither you nor
the Outside Interference draw a replacement card until
after you've either responded or passed on responding.

## Ending a Date

After someone plays a card onto one of the Status Stacks, they should
check to see if a date-ending condition has happened -- either all of the
**suits on the stack match**, or **all of the ranks match.**

When that happens, the date moves to the resolution phase.

These are examples of Status Stacks that end the date:
