# Using the Cards {#game}

:::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Instead of dice like many tabletop roleplaying games, 52 First Dates uses playing cards.](art/spectrum/group-cards.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You need to have two decks of cards to play []{.gamename}.

One deck is called the ***Date's Deck*** and is shared between the players
in the roles of the Date and the Outside Interference.

The other deck is called the ***System's Deck*** and is shared between players
in the role of the System.

At the beginning of each date, shuffle each deck and then lay out a row of
three cards on the table, from the top of the Date's Deck.
These are known as the ***Date Status stacks***. 
During the course of the date,
you'll play cards from your hand onto one of the stacks.
[The two decks will end up mixed together, which is why we recommend that
you use two decks with different backs -- it's easier to sort out after the
date!]{.spin}

## Your Hand

Each player, no matter which role they're playing, has a hand of five cards.
The hands of the Date and the Outside Interference are drawn from the top
of the Date's Deck, while the other players' hands are drawn from the
System's Deck.

After you play a card, draw another card from the appropriate deck.

## Matching Cards {.breakbefore}

Two cards **match suits** if their suits are the same -- such as clubs
or diamonds.

These cards match suits:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[7 of Spades]{.card .s .seven}
[King of Spades]{.card .s .king}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Two cards *match colors* if their suits are the same color -- black or red.
[]{.clubs} Clubs and []{.spades} spades are black suits, and
[]{.diamonds} diamonds and []{.hearts} hearts are red suits.

These cards match colors:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Ace of Clubs]{.card .c .ace}
[Jack of Spades]{.card .s .jack}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Two cards ***match ranks*** if their ranks are the same number or word,
such as Ace, 2, or Queen.

These cards match ranks:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .c .nine}
[Nine of Diamonds]{.card .d .nine}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

These cards don't match each other at all:

::::::::::: cardgroup :::::::::::::::::::
[Two of Diamonds]{.card .d .deuce}
[Queen of Spades]{.card .s .queen}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Choosing a Player {#game-choosing}

When you need to choose a player, such determining which role someone will
play in a date, all players turn over a card from the top of Date's Deck.
The player with the highest-ranked card is the one chosen.

To break a tie, players tied for the highest rank card draw a second card 
from the top of System's Deck.
