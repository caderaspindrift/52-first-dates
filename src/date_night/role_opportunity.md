# Playing as Opportunity {#date-role-opportunity .breakbefore }

![Text messages are a great way to interrupt the perfect date.](art/spectrum/phone-upset.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As Opportunity, your job is to introduce events that could make 
it harder for the parties on the date to make a love connection.

That said -- you're not the *enemy*; you aren't playing *against* the System and the
Prospect, just trying to make their Date Night more complicated.
[We talked about this during our playtests; we decided *against*
 calling this the "cock-blocker" role, even though at times it could 
 seem that way. It's the job of Opportunity to make Date
 Night *interesting*, and in fact, they might make it *more* likely for
 the System and Prospect to make a connection.]{.val}
[... also "cock-blocker" is sexist and genital-essentialist language.]{.carline}
[Yeah, that too.]{.val}

You can *only* play a card as long as the rank exactly matches the rank of a card played
by another player. You don't have a spot in the turn order, and it's possible that 
multiple turns can go by before you get a chance to play. That's okay -- you won't be
Opportunity forever, provided that your group plays out more than one Date Night.

Whenever you play a card, you get to describe the event that occurs, as determined by the
card's rank, as shown on the table on the following page.

In the table, "the character" refers to the character played by the person
whose card you just played on -- so the System and its current Fronter 
played on one of the Collective's cards, and the Prospect if played on the Date's
card.

If the card you play is a red card -- i.e. []{.hearts} Hearts or
[]{.diamonds} Diamonds -- then the additional details given above come
into play.

:::::::::::::::::::: {.eventchart .breakbefore .breakable .text } ::::::::::::::::::

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rank       Opportunity Event
----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ace     **Happy to Be Here!** 
            The character picks one of the Headmates not currently
            fronting, who switches to the front and is indifferent 
            about the switch.
            [On a red card, they're pleased with this switch.]{.red}

     2      **Stay For the Atmosphere** 
            Some sort of environment problem occurs, usually related
            to one or more senses or the weather.
            [For example: it's too loud, there's a bad smell, it's 
            raining, and so on.]{.eg}

     3      **See You In the Fall** 
            Someone nearby has a physical accident that interrupts the
            date. It probably shouldn't be seriously injurious.
            [On a red card, it directly affects the character.]{.red} 
            [For example: someone trips and falls on the character or
            a lost frisbee lands on the character's lap.]{.eg}

     4      **Capitalism Ruins Everything** 
            The character has to deal with the horrors of a capitalist
            society. (If you're not playing a game set in a capitalist
            society, good for you -- and you'll need to come up with
            something else instead for this rank.)
            [For example: they're out of cash, their debit card was
            declined, they lost their wallet, or their employer calls.]{.eg}

     5      **Excuse Me...?** 
            A harmless interruption occurs at an inconvenient time,
            such as just when someone was about to present a heart-baring
            answer to a deep question. The interrupter means no harm, and
            isn't intending to ruin the date.
            [For example: a small child approaches and asks if they're
            married, the server at a restaurant comes to take their order,
            or the character gets an insistent text message from 
            their friend asking how the date's going.]{.eg}

     6      **Wardrobe Malfunction** 
            A clothing-related problem happens.
            [For example: the character realizes they misplaced their hat,
            someone's shoes are untied, there's a spot of soup on their
            tie, and so on.]{.eg}

     7      **Forget-Me-Nots** 
            Suddenly the character realizes they've forgotten something.
            Opportunity gets to decide exactly what that might be.
            [On a red card, they forgot something about their date.]{.red} 
            [For example: they forgot their date's name, they forgot to
            pay attention to the time and missed their bus, they lost the
            keys to their house or car.]{.eg}

     8      **Consuming Passions** 
            A problem related to food and drink arises.
            [For example: the proverbial fly in the soup, the server 
            drops off the wrong order, a drink spills, or their date is
            allergic to the dish they just ordered.]{.eg}

     9      **Circumstances Beyond Our Control** 
            nobody could have predicted 
            These are problems that can't be directly controlled by the
            parties on the date. Including natural disasters.
            [For example: the power goes out, there's a traffic jam
            blocking their route to the park, an earthquake strikes.]{.eg}

    10      **Anything But This** 
            Opportunity picks one of the Headmates not
            current fronting, who switches to the front and is apathetic 
            about the switch.
            [On a red card, they're upset by this switch.]{.red}

   Jack     **Oh Shit, It's My Ex!** 
            Someone the character was previously involved with
            approaches the dating parties. This creates a named NPC; 
            see below for details.
            [On a red card, the ex and the character had a bad breakup]{.red}

   Queen    **"Why, Hel*lo* There** 
            A stranger takes an interest in the character and
            approaches the dating parties. This create a named NPC;
            see below for details.
            [On a red card, the stranger is attractive.]{.red}

   King     **What are *They* Doing Here?** 
            Someone the character knows approaches the dating parties
            and tries to start a conversation. This creates a named
            NPC; see below for details.
            [On a red card, it's someone the character can't stand]{.red}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After you've played a card, you describe the event that interrupts the
character of the player whose card you played on, substituting your
description for whatever they were about to say.

If that player can play a card on top of yours, they can do so, and if
so, they can describe how their response prevents the interruption.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Here's an example. Let's say that one of the Collective just played the 
Two of []{.spades} Spades, and described a witty comment from the System.

But you play the Two of Hearts in response. According to the event table,
this means something "atmospheric" interfered. You say something like this:

"They just said this really clever pun, and that's great! But unfortunately ...
the noise at the restaurant suddenly increased as there's a child's party
at the next table and they're singing 'Happy Birthday'. 
The Prospect couldn't hear you."

The Collective could then respond with another card from the same suit, if
they've got any []{.hearts} Hearts in their hand. If so, then they could
describe how they're getting around the party song obstacle -- perhaps
by leaning in closer.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::: {.sidebar       } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Should you end the date?]{.sidehead}

If you can play a card and it would result in the date ending --
all of the suits match or all of the ranks match -- you can certainly
do so! It might go down like this: 

"Someone's approaching the table -- oh, shit, it's your ex!" <br/>
"Hey, they're all []{.spades} Spades -- so the date ends, right?" <br/>
"You're right -- so we don't even need to play a card to respond." <br/>
"Yeah, so how about this -- we duck out the back, quickly, happy to be away from that person. Laughing, we realize that it's getting late anyway ... so now we go to the Wrap-Up phase." <br/>
"Sounds good!" 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::: {.sidebar .next } :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Should you end the date? (continued)]{.sidehead}

The bigger question is "should you stop the *other* players from ending the date"?

Which you could probably do from time to time. If they've just played the
third []{.hearts} Hearts card, the date would normally end there, 
but if you can play on that new card and do so ... you'd be prolonging
the date.

Which you certainly can do! This is one of the perks of being the 
Opportunity. And unless you and the other players are tired
of the date, you probably *should*. It'll make things more interesting.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After you play a card to a stack, turn that stack on its side to indicate 
that an event is going on. Like this:

:::::::::::::::: cardstacks ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Two   of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h .tapped}
[Three of Spades]{.card .three .s        }
[Five of Clubs  ]{.card .five  .c        }
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The event continues to influence the date as long as that card is still showing.
When another player plays a card to that stack, turn the stack back up; the
other player gets to describe why that event is no longer a factor.

**Exception:** If the fronting Headmate changes, don't rotate the stack.

::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Let's say that the Collective couldn't counter the "Happy Birthday" card -- that
means the situation is ongoing. While it doesn't automatically interrupt 
future card plays, there's still this loud child's birthday party one booth
away.

On their next turn, the Date plays the Jack of []{.spades} Spades on that
stack, describing the Prospect making a joke about not wanting to intrude on
the festivities and recommending that they and the System move to the bar
for a drink. The Date then returns the stack to its upright position.

:::::::::::::::: cardstacks ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
[Jack of Spades]{.card .jack .s}
[Three of Spades]{.card .three .s        }
[Five of Clubs  ]{.card .five  .c        }
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Named NPCs {#date-npcs}

Many of the events assume that other people exist -- such as the serving staff if the date takes place in a 
restaurant. While you *can* give these people names, you don't *have* to.

However, if you play a *face card* -- meaning a Jack, Queen, or King -- then 
you **have to give that person a name,** and probably pronouns as well.

You're creating what's called a *named NPC* -- "NPC" is an abbreviation for "non-player character"; it's a
tabletop gaming term that means "anyone who isn't a player character." In our case, it means anyone who isn't
either part of the System or the Prospect.

Once you've come up with a name<span class="dera">
  If you can't come up with a name on short notice, 
  you can flip one card and use the table for 
  the Prospect's name on [](#setup-prospect-name){.page}.
</span>
and pronouns<span class="dera">
  Likewise, you can use the table for the Prospect's pronouns
  on [](#setup-prospect-pronouns){.page}, 
  or just flip a single card -- <br/> 
  [Spades]{.spades} for she/her,<br/>
  [Hearts]{.hearts} for he/him,<br/> and
  [Diamonds]{.diamonds} for they/them,<br/>
  [Clubs]{.clubs} for other pronouns.
</span>,
record those on the Opportunity Sheet next to the exact card you played, 
and announce those to the other players.

As long as the card you played is active, the named NPC sticks around and interferes
with the System and Prospect. During this time, you should roleplay the NPC as a hindrance
preventing the others from having open communication. 

Once the card is no longer in play, the named NPC leaves -- you can decide exactly how
and narrate their exit accordingly!

Each kind of named NPC gives you a chance to get input from the other players that you
can use to shape how you roleplay.

Named NPCs can be risky. Most of the time when you play a card, it's okay to describe 
the event in an over-the-top manner, but named NPCs by implication have an emotional connection
to the characters. You should approach this carefully and check often with the
other players.

### Oh, Shit, It's My Ex!

Whenever you play a Jack, someone from the character's past shows up -- someone who they
were involved with, presumably in a romantic and/or sexual sense.

If the Jack is a red card -- the Jack of Hearts or the Jack of Diamonds -- then it was a
bad breakup; otherwise, they're still on good terms.

After you announce the name and pronouns of the ex, ask each player:

> What does this person look like?

Then ask the player whose card you just 
played on these questions:
<span class="carline">
 Before you do, you should do a quick check with the other players to make sure
 they're okay with going forward -- if you're using the O card
 (see [](#toolkit-xno-cards){.page}) or Script Change 
 ([](#toolkit-script-change){.page}) safety tools, this is a good place to use
 them. You might also want to check after the question is answered, too, if the
 one or more of the players seems upset. It *can* be upsetting to have one's
 ex suddenly appear, even if it's just a game!
</span>

> Why did they break up? Whose fault was it?

### Why, Hel*lo* There

When you play a Queen, someone in the scene takes an interest in one of the characters.
In most cases this is a stranger, although you can modify that based on the circumstances.

After you name the NPC and their pronouns, ask each of the other players:

> What does this person look like?

If you played a red Queen -- the Queen of Hearts or the Queen of Diamonds -- then the
named NPC is *attractive*. 
Ask the player whose card you just played on:

> What about this NPC is attractive to your character?

If it wasn't a red Queen, then ask the player:

> What makes this NPC unattractive to your character?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![If your date doesn't go well but you meet someone else you like -- be sure to get *their* number!](art/spectrum/phone.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### What are *They* Doing Here?

When you play a King, someone from the character's life shows up. This could be a friend,
a co-worker or boss, a relative, 
[*OH SHIT, IT'S MY MOM.*]{.aura}
someone from school, and so on.

If you played a red King -- the King of Hearts or the King of Diamonds -- then it's someone
who the character can't stand. Ask the player whose card you just played on:

> Why can't your character stand this NPC?

If it wasn't a red King, then ask the player:
[An example of a good answer is "well, because that would cause problems at the office."]{.spin}

> Why won't your character just politely ask them to leave?

## Recurring NPCs {#date-recurring}

The reason you write down the named NPCs is that they might show up again on future Date
Nights!

If you're playing Opportunity and the NPC Roster already has a listing for
the card you played, that named NPC could show up instead, under the following 
circumstances:

1. **The character from the previous Date Night is present at this Date Night.** 
   In other words, if the ex was the System's ex, then that ex can reappear; but if
   it was the Prospect's ex, they'll only show up again if this is a subsequent date
   with the same Prospect.
   [If you really want, you can break this rule -- maybe the same person also dated
    nearly everyone the System goes out with! -- with the approval of the other
    players present.]{.spin}

2. **None of the players object to that named NPC reappearing.** If someone says
   they don't want to see a given NPC again, then that person doesn't show up.
   It's important to distinguish between a player just bemoaning the appearance of
   an NPC -- "oh no, not this guy again!" -- and a player genuinely objecting
   to the NPC re-entering the game.

If the named NPC doesn't reappear then just erase their name from the roster and
create a new one with the usual procedure.

## I Just Met You and This Song is Ableist {#date-maybe}

So what happens if the named NPC is actually rather pleasant and got along well with
the System? Assuming that there's a chance to slip in a quick
"Here's my number, so call me maybe?",
[The title of that song is ableist.]{.carline}
[Oh c'mon Carline, you know it's a joke]{.aura}
[... an *ableist* joke.]{.carline}
[She's right, you know.]{.dera}
[wait, *who* is right?]{.aura}
[Not you.]{.dera}
[:p]{.aura}
the players could choose to have the named NPC be the next Prospect instead of making a
completely new one from scratch.

If that's the case, you can skip the name and pronouns part of the Prospect creation
process, but still match against the Headmates' ideal partner and draw two Trait Cards
for the Prospect.
