# Who's Fronting? {#date-fronting}

At the start of Date Night, lay out all of the Headmate sheets and deal one card on
top of each from the Date's Deck. The Headmate with the highest card rank is currently
fronting.

If the deal results in a tie for highest, you could either break the tie with cards 
drawn from the top of the System's Deck, or could assume that all tied Headmates are
in a [co-conscious](#lexicon-co-conscious){.defn} or
[co-fronting](#lexicon-co-fronting){.defn} situation.
