# Playing as the Collective {#date-role-collective .breakbefore}

When you are playing []{.gamename} as the Collective, you're controlling the 
words and actions of the System character -- and specifically, of the Headmate 
who is currently fronting in that system.

If there are more than 3 people playing, the Collective is a shared role between
two or more players. One person plays the Date role, another the Opportunity
role, and the remaining players are in the role of the Collective.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spectrum :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
![Likewise, the System wants to make a good impression on the Date.](art/spectrum/mirror.jpg)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

While playing as the Collective, you alternate turns between all of the players
in that role, in order. Designate one of those players as the first Collective
member, another as the second, and so on until each has a number; this helps you
keep track of who plays a card next, alternating with the Date.

In some ways the Collective counts as a single role, and in others as a shared
role between mutiple players -- which isn't necessarily far off from what it's like
for some systems in real life.

## Summary of Collective Rules

As members of the Collective, you're responsible for steering the System character
through the date. You each have a separate hand of cards, drawn from the System's
Deck[](#glossary-system-deck){.defn}, and when it's your turn, you can play those
cards on any Status Stack as long as either the **suit** or the **rank** of the
card matches the top card of the stack.

If you have at least one card that you *could* play, then you're required to play
one such card on your turn. If you don't have any at all, the System character is
At A Loss for Words, and the Opportunity player can play a card on *any* stack,
not just the last card played.

Whenever an Opportunity event card is played on a card you've just played, you can
respond by playing a card to counter that event. It's not *required* that you do
so, but if you do, the card must follow your normal rule for playing cards; either
the suit or the rank has to match.

Even though the Collective are treated as one role controlling one character, you
can only respond to Opportunity Events played on a card that you, the player,
have played -- not on cards played by your fellow Collective members.

[Should you end the date?]{.sidehead}

In a game of []{.gamename}, the Collective actually has the least ability of the
three players to control when a date ends. In some cases, the only play you make
would result in a match, and you're required to take it -- even if you don't want
the date to end.

That's okay! Don't sweat it. Your goal shouldn't be prolong the game, or even necessarily
shoot for a second date or intimacy for the System character. It's to have 
fun playing the game and tell a (pardon the pun) collective story.

Ending a Date Night also means that the roles change, in which case you could end
up in the Date role for the next game.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## The Goal of the Collective

All players in a game of []{.gamename} have the same ultimate goal: to have fun
telling a dating story. When you are playing the Collective for a Date Night, you
get to roleplay as the System, giving voice to their thoughts and description to
their actions.

But how should you roleplay that?

At any given time, there will be one Headmate who is fronting[](#lexicon-fronting){.defn};
that's who you should roleplay. Place the appropriate Headmate Sheet in front of 
you and the other Collective players for reference. Each Headmate has their own
name, pronouns, sexuality, interests, personality. and desired qualities in a date.
Use those as a guideline to shape how you play the character.

You can also coordinate with other members of the Collective to decide what you're
going to do next -- although you shouldn't spend too much time, in the middle of Date
Night, creating an elaborate plan. You *can* show your fellow Collective members the
cards in your hand, although you can't trade them back and forth.

## What *Can't* You Do?

When you're playing as a member of the Collective, you're relatively free to 
decide how the System acts, within these three constraints:

- As with the Date, you can't roleplay a mood unless you've got a card to
  play that matches that mood. 
  [The first constraint exists to model social pressure.]{.dera}

- You have to roleplay as the Headmate who is fronting. If that Headmate
  uses she/her pronouns and is into sports, you can't switch to he/they
  pronouns and roleplay a dislike of sports. 
  [The second constraint reinforces the idea that each Headmate is a
   unique person in their own right]{.carline}

- You have to keep the System masked[](#lexicon-masked){.defn}: in other words,
  you can't just have the System tell the Date or other characters that 
  they're a system.
  [The third constraint reflects the widespread misinformation, fear, and
   bigotry directed against plural systems.]{.val}

On a second date with the same Prospect, you can lift the third constraint
with that Prospect -- but only if you've achieved intimacy and your group
decided that part of that intimacy involved disclosure of the System's
plural status.

## Switching Fronters {#date-switch}

The Opportunity player has two types of cards that can 
switch[](#lexicon-switch){.defn} whoever is fronting -- if they play an Ace, that's
the **Happy to Be Here!** event, and if they play a Ten, that's the **Anything But This**
event.

Within the fiction of the game, this means that a new Headmate starts fronting; this
could be an abrupt switch or a gradual one. 

As players of the Collective, you are no longer playing the same character as before;
while the System's body remains the same, the fictional character controlling that
body is a different person. This means that you no longer play the previous fronter;
put that Headmate Sheet aside, and start playing as the new fronter.

The cards that trigger a switch are summarized in the following table.

 Cards                                         Event             Results
------------                                   ----------------- ------------------------
A [Spades]{.spades}, A [Clubs]{.clubs}         Happy to Be Here! Collective/Date chooses fronter; fronter is indifferent
A [Hearts]{.hearts}, A [Diamonds]{.diamonds}   Happy to Be Here! Collective/Date chooses fronter; fronter is pleased 
10 [Spades]{.spades}, 10 [Clubs]{.clubs}       Anything But This Opportunity chooses fronter; fronter is apathetic
10 [Hearts]{.hearts}, 10 [Diamonds]{.diamonds} Anything But This Opportunity chooses fronter; fronter is displeased

### Happy to Be Here!

When Opportunity plays an Ace card, that means the new fronting Headmate is
chosen by the player whose card was played on. If that player is one of the Collective,
that person gets to pick the new fronter, and if it was the Date's card, the
Date player get to choose.

Io Opportunity plays a red Ace, that means that the new fronter is happy to move
up to the front, and you should roleplay the System character appropriately! On
a black Ace, the Headmate is indifferent to the switch.

### Anything But This

Conversely, if a Ten is played, the new fronter is chosen by the Opportunity 
player. A red Ten means that Headmate definitely is *not* happy to find themselves
pushed to the front, and on a black Ten, they're merely apathetic about the change.
In either case, you and the other Collective members should play out those feelings
as you roleplay the character.

### Responding to Fronter Changes

You *can* choose to respond to the change of fronter. Unlike other Opportunity Events,
though, this doesn't stop the switch from happening -- the previously fronting
Headmate is no longer fronting.

Instead, successfully responding to an *Anything But This* or *Happy to Be Here!*
event lets you
