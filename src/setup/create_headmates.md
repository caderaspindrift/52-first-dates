# Creating the Headmates {#setup-headmates }

Once you've created the System, you need to create the members of that system -- the Headmates.

Each player takes a blank Headmate Sheet and chooses a name or nickname for this Headmate.
But wait! Don't fill in anything else.  Instead pass that to the player on your left.

Then, when you get a Headmate Sheet passed to you by the player on your right, fill in 
the topmost empty box. Then pass that sheet to your left.

Continue doing this until all fields on all Headmate Sheets are filled out.

## Name or Nickname

Just think up any name you wish; nicknames count too. If you can't think of a good
name, choose a color or the name of a fictional character
[See the definition of "fictive" on <a href="#lexicon-fictive" class="page"></a>!]{.spin}
or a profession.

## Pronouns

Choose any pronouns you've heard of that you like. They can be anything; go wild here.

## Sexuality

You can write any sort of sexuality you wish, including asexual identities. The 
[split attraction model](https://www.aromanticism.org/en/news-feed/splitting-attraction-history-j4y96)
or something like it may be useful here.

How important will this be in a game of []{.gamename}? Not *overly* so; we make the assumption
that the characters on the date will be queer enough to adequately cover any forms of
attraction -- sexual, romantic, or otherwise -- that may arise. Ultimately we're telling
stories about dating and plurality, not necessarily about incompatible attraction parameters.
[That said, if your group thinks it would be interesting to play out scenarios where the
Headmates' attractions don't include the Prospect, or vice versa, go for it -- but first
check in with everyone using your safety tools.]{.carline}

## Interests

Pick one thing that this Headmate finds particularly interesting. It could be an activity,
such as "flirting"; it could be a field of study, such as "computer science"; it could be
a type of object, such as "cars"; it could be a color, such as "orange"; it could be a
a profession or group of people, such as "pirates"; it could be a religion or belief system, 
such as "Scottish witchcraft."

## Demeanor

This should be a vague statement of what the Headmate's personality is like, under normal
circumstances. (Note that for most people, a date *isn't* a normal circumstance.)
[It is for me tho]{.aura}

If you've read up on roles within a system, such as [protector](#lexicon-protector){.defn} 
or [host](#lexicon-host){.defn}, you could give that role here.
[We highly advise *against* creating a Headmate with the role of 
<a href="#lexicon-persecutor" class="defn">persecutor</a>. 
While it could lead to interesting roleplay scenarios, it's also very likely that your 
group won't really understand what's involved with a persecutor and those misconceptions 
go against the purpose of this game.]{.spin}

## Ideal Partner Quality

While some fields aren't used extensively in the game, this one is! 
Write down one thing that the Headmate would ideally like to see in a partner -- which
could mean a romantic partner, could mean a sexual partner, or could even mean a 
platonic partner.

This will come into play when you create a Prospect: you'll draw cards to randomly
determine if the Prospect has that desired quality or not.

Being specific is more helpful than being vague. For example, "good sense of humor"
is fine, but "a compatible sense of humor" is better and more realistic, and 
"enjoys bad puns" is even better.

## Notes

Unless there's something you really want to note about the Headmate at this point,
you can leave the "Notes" box empty.

## Introduce the Headmate

Once all of the Headmate Sheets are fully completed, each player should take one and 
introduce the Headmate to all the players. This could be simply reading each field in
order, or it could be a more complex introduction, perhaps given in character.

## Headmates are Group Property

An important thing to keep in mind is that no player has exclusive rights to a Headmate,
even if they named or introduced that Headmate. All Headmates are shared between all
players, and the players in the Collective role might be called upon to roleplay any
or all of them during the course of Date Night!
