# Creating the System {#setup-system}

This is both the most simple part of the set-up and the most complicated,
because there aren't a lot of rules mechanics involving cards here -- just
questions for a group to decide collectively between themselves.
[This was also one of the harder parts of the game to write, and one we
saved until the end because we had to make sure we had the rest of the game
sorted first]{.carline}

In this part of the set-up, you and the other players are going to create
the shared protagonist character that will be used in all the dates.

## How We Create the System

Before we get to that, let's go over some general groundrules here:

1. This should be **collaborative**, meaning that ideally you reach consensus
   among everyone.
2. This should be **fluid**, meaning that it's okay to go back and change
   something you'd decided before, if everyone's okay with that.
3. This should be **resolvable**. meaning that if you hit a hurdle, you
   have a way of getting past it.
4. This should be **safe**, meaning that you fully observe and use the
   safety tools [](#the-toolkit){.page} you went over at the start of the game.

It's not possible for me sitting out in here in book-writing-land to tell you
how you can all work together on coming to a decision. Ultimately that's down
to your group dynamics. 

But here's a helpful tool you can use: if you're not able to come to a decision
easily, place your options metaphorically on locations on the table, and then
deal a card onto each from the Date's Deck. The highest card is the option you
go with. 

This has the effect of separating the idea from the person who proposed it, which
is good, and also helps you lay those options out and look them as you flip the
cards. This is what I mean by *resolvable*.

And of course, if someone is dead-set against a certain option based on 
safety grounds -- and they *aren't* required to explain full details of why,
remember! -- then you should politely move on to other choices instead.

## Basic Assumptions about the System

Going into this scenario, with the game being written as it is, we already
know several things about the System who are our protagonists.
[It's important to stress that this is just one way that a System can
work! these decisions were made based on playability and appropriateness
for a game for general audiences -- not as a way of fully expressing the
diversity of plural experiences!]{.carline}

Our System is Plural

~   I mean, obviously, or else we wouldn't be playing *this* game.

Our System has Several Members

~   In real life, a system can have anywhere from two (or one?) members
    to hundreds or even uncountable numbers. For purposes of this game,
    however, we're only concerning ourselves with the same number of
    Headmates as there are players. Maybe there are more system members
    out there -- they're just not appearing in this game.

Our System is an Adult

~   Yeah, we're not going to make a game about teenagers dating and possibly
    getting laid, and I highly recommend you don't play []{.gamename}
    as such a game.

Our System Doesn't Have Littles

~   A little[](#lexicon-little){.page} is a headmate who is considerably
    younger than the system's physical body, and is almost always underage.
    We're avoiding that for the same reason our System is an adult; you
    could even consider that perhaps littles exist in the System, but just
    aren't appearing in this game.
    [Our system doesn't have any littles. Aura's immaturity doesn't count.]{.dera}
    [*RUDE!!*]{.aura}

Our System Shares Memories

~   It's hard enough playing a roleplaying game where you're going to be
    alternating turns playing a Headmate who might switch with another
    at any notice -- we don't want you to have to remember who knows what.

    So for simplicity's sake, everyone in the System both knows that
    they're Headmates, and has access to knowing or experiencing what is
    currently happening.
    (See the definition of memory sharing on [](#lexicon-memory-sharing){.page}.)

Our System is *Not* a Median System

~   In a median system [Like ours!]{.aura}, the headmates are sometimes called
    "facets" and the differences between them can be less distinct than in 
    other systems. 

    Median systems[](#lexicon-median){.xref} are often 
    conceptualized as "midway" between singlets and plurals. As a design
    decision, we thought the game would play better with a non-median system.

Our System is Not Openly Plural

~   This was a tough call but ultimately, given the widespread 
    pluralphobia[](#lexicon-pluralphobia){.defn} in society, it makes more
    sense to present a game where the System isn't out and proud about
    their plurality. 

    This is sometimes called **masking**[](#lexicon-masked){.defn},
    a term borrowed from autistic folks' experiences, and is analogous to
    being "stealth" in a transgender context.

Our System is Looking For Love

~   Or if not *love* per se, at least some kind of intimacy. That's not the
    goal of *everyone* who goes out on a date, but for purposes of the game
    it's simple enough to say that collectively, our System would like to
    both find intimacy with someone else and go on a second date with them.

Our System Is Probably Queer

~   This was another one we had to think about, but ultimately it made sense --
    we're honestly unfamiliar with any plural systems that *aren't* either
    collectively queer or that contain at least a few queer members. See below.

## Gender and Sexuality

The assumption for []{.gamename} is that the sexualities and genders of the
System, the Headmates, and the Prospect match up enough that some kind of
love connection is possible. So the Prospect probably isn't a TERF, the
Headmates aren't necessarily opposed to dating someone of any gender, and
so on.

This doesn't mean a kind of enforced pansexuality is in play, though! Again,
we're just sitting here in California writing this game book, some unknown
period of time before you're reading it. We obviously can't force you to play
a certain way!

Since issues of gender and sexuality can be real-world hot-button issues for
some players, this is another situation in which safety tools need to be
used, especially lines and veils.

You need to consider whether you think the following possible scenarios
might be enjoyable to play, and whether everyone would feel comfortable
and safe playing with each:

An asexual, aromantic Headmate doesn't even want to be on this date.

~   While this could be realistic for some systems, it's also not a very
    fun way of playing the game. But even more importantly, it shows a limited
    understanding of what it means to be asexual and aromantic -- surprise,
    many of them *do* date, many of them *do* get in relationships, many of
    them *do* even have sex! Keep that in mind as you discuss this scenario.

One of the Headmates isn't attracted to people of the Prospect's gender.

~   Again, this could happen in real life. Should it happen in your game,
    though? It could be quite disturbing for some people to have to play
    out in a game the kind of gender- and sexuality-based rejection that
    so common for queer people. You should draw a line here if that's
    going to upset anyone.

The Prospect isn't attracted to people of the Headmate's gender, just the System's body.

~   This is why we assume the Prospect is "pansexual enough" to accept 
    most anyone. The alternative would be something like this: we say
    the System presents as female, the Prospect is lesbian, and one of
    the Headmates is male. That Headmate could feel very conflicted, much
    like a closeted trans person -- and again, such scenarios can stir
    up emotions that could make the game less comfortable and safe for
    some players.

We strongly recommend that you avoid all of these scenarios just by deciding
they're not going to happen. You could try otherwise -- it *could* be an
interesting game to play -- but it feels too much like misery tourism to
make such concepts central to the game.

## Neurodiversity, Race, and Disability {#setup-neuro}

One last caveat to touch on before we get into specific questions about
the System -- what *other* sorts of marginalized groups the System is part
of.

We know from both anecdotal evidence and actual studies that plural systems
can come from all walks of life and are often multiply marginalized --
it's not uncommon for plural people to be autistic, to be BIPOCs, to be
physically or mentally disabled.

While it would therefore be realistic to portray the System character as
possessing some or all of those characteristics, this is another place that
we are going to urge caution:

**Don't Treat Real People's Lives as Toys for Your Entertaiment**

Seems kind of strange coming from a game in which singlets are welcome to
play plural systems, right? 

But the thing is, the plurality parts of this game are very structured and
contained, and we've spent the first 20 pages or so giving you an infodump
about plurality. While we're just one system and we can't speak for everyone,
we still *are* plural and can at least steer you toward what you need to know
to play this game responsibly.

We're not able to do that with those other characteristics, though. We're not
autistic, or non-white, or physically disabled
[We're mentally disabled, with depression and anxiety on top of C-PTSD and
ADHD -- but this game isn't about that in particular, though.]{.carline},
so we're not qualified to design the game in a way that would be respectful
and representative.

In general, I think this is a good rule of thumb:  **Don't suggest a marginalized
identity for the System (or the Prospect, even) unless you share that same
identity.** 

## System Creation Process

Once you've talked over the caveats and set any extra lines or veils that your
group needs to proceed safely, take out a copy of the System Sheet. You could
either have one person fill it out with the group's answers, or pass it around.

The things you need to decide are:

1. The name the System uses in daily life.
2. The System's apparent gender identity
3. The System's pronouns.
4. The age of the System's body.
5. The general appearance of the System.
6. Any other details you want to add.

### Name

You could probably switch the first two options so that you choose the gender
first and then the name; it's up to you. If you can't come up with a name at
all, you can jump ahead to [](#setup-prospect-name){.section}, which helps you
choose a name by picking a card.

But hopefully you can come up with a name that you all agree on.

### Gender Identity

Regardless of the genders of the Headmates -- who you'll be creating in the next
section -- you also need to determine how the System outwardly presents to
the world. Male, female, non-binary, some combination of those, or something
differently entirely?

### Pronouns

Pronouns follow gender identity but that doesn't mean that the two concepts
map 1:1 with each other. The System could present as a cis male but prefers
they/them or she/her pronouns. They might prefer a neopronoun such as
fae/faer[ &#203c; &#1f60d; &#1f57a;]{.fox}
[... Yes, <span class="fox-emoji"></span>, we know that's one of your pronouns.]{.dera},
or maybe they don't like pronouns at all?

If you have several suggestions on the table, remember that it's entirely possible
for someone to have multiple sets of pronouns they accept -- and the chances are
even higher when you're talking about a system.

### Age

The System's body is *probably* somewhere between 18 and 72. Broad range, right?
You can choose either an approximate age -- such as "in their twenties" -- or
a specific age, like 52.

If you need a random way to come up with an age, do this: deal five cards off the
top of the System's Deck. Add them up, counting Aces as 1 and face cards as 10.
Then add 15 to that number. Ta da, you've now generated a number between 20 and 65.
[or you can just ignore Dera's little math games and pick for yourselves]{.aura}

### Appearance

For appearance, a red-robin approach makes the most sense. Starting with one
player and proceeding around the group, everyone says one detail about the
appearance of the System's appearance that gets added to the list. 
[Keep those X-cards, N-cards, and O-cards handy for this one!
 See <a href="#toolkit-xno-cards" class="page"></a> for details]{.carline}

If you have 4 or fewer players, you can go through everyone a second time,
adding another detail.

Some things to consider:

- Is the System tall or short? Thin or fat?
- Does the System wear glasses?
- What color of hair, eyes, skin
  [see the section above, about making a System with marginalizations you
   don't share]{.carline} does the System have?
- What kind of clothes does the System wear? How do they reinforce or
  subvert their stated gender identity?
- What setting-specific appearance details make sense? If this is a cyberfuture,
  do they have any built-in cyberware? If this is in a fantasy world, what
  kind of armor do they wear?
- Which buttons, pins, and flag stickers do they have?
- What would they carry with them to a date?

### Other Details

You can add extra details about the System if you like. Maybe you want to
specify their relationship status at this time -- seeing someone, wants out,
single, polyamorous, just broke up?

Does your System have a job? Will it matter? If you think it will, either
choose it now or wait for it come to up in roleplay and decide then.

### Review Your System

Once you've finished the steps above, take a step back and look over the System
as you've defined them. This is your chance to tweak anything that doesn't seem
just right, or to fill in more information that you didn't realize until you
had the bigger picture in front of you.

When everyone has affirmatively signalled that they're pleased with the
System you've collectively built, then you can go on to the next section.
