# Determining Roles {#date-roles}

Before each Date Night, you need to determine which role each player will play.
As described in [](#game-choosing){.section}, you do this by drawing cards.

## The First Date Night

If this is the first Date Night you're playing, each player draws a card from the Date's Deck
The player with the highest ranked card plays the Date role, and the player with the
next highest card plays the Opportunity; all other players play the Fronter role.
Break ties by drawing cards from the System's Deck.

## Subsequent Date Nights

The player who was the previous Date Night's Opportunity plays the Date, and the
previous Date Night's Date is a Fronter. From the previous Date Night's Fronters, each player
who hasn't been the Date before draws a card and the player with the highest card plays 
the Opportunity. Again, break ties with draws from the System's Deck.
