# Determining Roles {#date-roles}

Before each Date Night, you need to determine which role each player will play.
As described in [](#game-choosing){.section}, you do this by drawing cards.

## The First Date Night

If this is the first Date Night you're playing, each player draws a card from the Date's Deck
The player with the highest ranked card plays the Date role, and the player with the
next highest card plays Opportunity; all other players play the Collective role.
Break ties by drawing cards from the System's Deck.

## Subsequent Date Nights

The player who was the previous Date Night's Opportunity plays the Date, and the
previous Date Night's Date plays the Collective. From the previous Date Night's Fronters, 
each player who hasn't been the Date before draws a card and the player with the 
highest card plays Opportunity; the rest are the Collective. 
Again, break ties with draws from the System's Deck.
