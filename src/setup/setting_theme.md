[]{.gamename} is a game about people. Plural people, singlet people, and the
random people we bump into on on a date.

It's not a game about dragons, dungeons, wars, stars, lasers, spells, or anything
else like that.

At least ... it doesn't have to be.

Our default assumption is that []{.gamename} represents a contemporary Western setting,
somewhere in the first few decades of the 21st Century. The System character and 
the Prospect live in a relatively cosmopolitan city where queerness is accepted and
celebrated, and where inroads are being made against ableism and pluralphobia but aren't
quite there yet.

The two characters were set up on an arranged date by a mutual friend who, while not 
knowing the System is plural, has a basic understanding of the persona that they and
the Prospect present to the world.

You don't have to play it that way, though.

If your group agrees, you could change the setting. Maybe this isn't in 2021, but is
set in a future resemembling *Star Trek*'s 23rd and 24th Centuries. Or a darker,
*Bladerunner*-style future. Post-apocalypse mutated animals? Anime-infused cyberpunk?
Not actually the future, but *a long time ago, in galaxy far, far away...*?

Or maybe there *are* swords and sorcery. The characters could be meeting in a bar in
Waterdeep, got hooked up in Bright Moon between fights against the Horde, or are
graduates of rival magical academies (run by transphobes), set up by a mutual friend.

Maybe the friend isn't even a friend. A dating site serves the same role; or an
all-powerful computer in a grim cyberfuture, or an oracle in the mythic past.

You *certainly* don't have to place your game in North America, I hope that goes without
saying -- but I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that haphazardly choosing 
non-white cultures for "play" in games is rather, uh, colonialist.

That said, it's also okay to stick to the default. It's easier and more comfortable
if you aren't trying to figure out what the high elf view of gender might be, or
whether Trills are inherently plural 
[I mean, Trills kind of *are* plural.]{.dera}

[I HAPPEN TO HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT TRILLS, OKAY?]{.dera}
[...]{.ora}, 
or what-have-you. 

In addition to the setting, you can add on themes to the game, which usually means
there's something that one or more of you want to focus on with the characters.
Some possible themes include:

- Queer liberation
- A simple study date at college
- Healing after a bad relationship
- Date Night gets caught up in an unrelated heist movie and goes horribly wrong
- A sweet and tender night out
- Capitalism ruins everything

I'm not going to give you much more of a list than that, because I don't want to
restrict your own creativity. []{.gamename} may have been created by us, but it's
*your* game to play as you wish!

The important thing is communication amongst the players. Be open and honest about
what you think you might enjoy, what you're willing to try, and what you absolutely
don't want to happen. Use the heck out of the safety tools (see [](#the-toolkit"){.page}).
Be willing to experiment, but don't forget to take care of yourselves.

Most of all, go have fun!
