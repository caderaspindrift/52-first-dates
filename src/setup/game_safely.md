# Game Safely {#setup-safely}

Dating can be an emotional rollercoaster for most of us
[even those of us already in an ongoing relationship!]{.aura},
and when dealing with issues of attraction, gender, sexuality,
and desire, those emotions might come to the surface just
by playing a roleplaying game.

For that reason, we strongly recommend that you use some of the
tools in the TTRPG Safety Toolkit, which starts on [](#the-toolkit){.page}.

**Lines and Veils** (see [](#toolkit-lines-and-veils){.page}) are the
first place to start, by defining which things you don't want to see at
all in []{.gamename}, and which things you're okay with occuring -- but
only off-screen.

Some specific examples that you might to consider for lines or veils include:

- Sexual banter and innuendo
- References to explicit sex acts
- Queerphobia of any kind, including as outside interference
- Other forms of bigotry and oppression, such as ableism or racism
- Abusive relationships, either past or present
- Infidelity
- BDSM, kink, and fetishes
- "Negging" and other insults

The **Script Change Ratings** ([](#toolkit-script-change-rating){.page})
tool lets you rate the game in the same way movies, television shows, or
comic books are rated. You can use those to decide when to fast forward,
rewind, pause, or resume the date.

(Most people in the United States are familiar with 
[MPAA movie ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system), 
but they're a very coarse tool when looking at tabletop roleplaying scenarios.
(Many of the ratings rely on determining whether a parent should be present,
how is that supposed to work here?)
[Oh, I should add that <span class="gamename"></span> is not a game intended
for small children. Our assumption is that all participants are adults]{.carline}
The [television content advisory system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_pay_television_content_advisory_system)
isn't much better, parsing out "four uses of at least two expletives" in a way
that's unworkable for gaming and concerning itself with visual imagery.)

One of the most widespread safety tools in the tabletop RPG hobby is the 
**X Card** ([](#toolkit-xno-cards)) that players can use to signal when they
need something to stop. We also recommend the use of the **N and O cards**
as well, to stave off problems before they become an issue.

## The Meaning of Intimacy {#setup-safely-intimacy}

One of the two primary outcomes in []{.gamename} -- and one of the presumed
goals of the protagonist System -- is to become intimate with another person.

The word "intimacy" was specifically chosen instead of the more crass "get laid"
not just because it sounds more high-falutin', but also because it's *not*
true that most people going on dates want *sex*.

It *is* fair to say that for the most part, people going on dates are hoping to
find someone with whom they feel enough of a conneciton that they can let down
their normal barriers and share who they are and what matters to them.

That's what we're labeling *intimacy* here. 

It could be any of these, or more:
[Or playing a roleplaying game together!
<span class="aura">only you would find that "intimate", Dera"</span>]{.dera}

- A wild night of kinky sex
- Opening up about a deep-seated trauma in your past
- Taking the Prospect home to meet your family
- Staying up late talking about everything and anything
- Binge-watching your favorite television show together
- Telling your Prospect about being a System

When you have the pre-game discussion about safety, especially lines and
veils, be sure to ask what kinds of intimacy the players are okay with
exploring, and which types they'd rather avoid.

The assumption in []{.gamename} is that Date Night ends long *before*
any actual intimacy occurs -- we're not expecting groups to play out either
sex scenes or deep conversations until dawn. But you might want to either
pull the veil a little sooner, or drop a line and not cross it, based on
some types of intimacy that might arise.
