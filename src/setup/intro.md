Now that you know how the cards work, we're going to tell you how 
the game is set up.
["the set-up" has a double meaning, see, because not only is this section about
preparing the game, but the whole conceit of the game is that it's a blind
date that you were *set up* on]{.aura}

Before the first Date Night, you have to do the following:

- Go over basic safety procedures
- Decide on the setting and themes of the game
- Create the System
- Create the Headmates

Before *each* Date Night, including the first, you need to:

- Assign Roles
- Create the Prospect
- Set the Scene
