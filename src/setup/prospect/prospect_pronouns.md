# The Prospect's Pronouns {#setup-prospect-pronouns}

Once you have the name of the Propect, you'll need their pronouns.
Draw one card to determine their primary pronoun, and then draw a second
to determine another set of pronouns they also use. 
[Here's a mnemonic for these -- **S**pades starts with an "S", as does
"she/her"; **H**earts and "he/him" with an "H"; **C** for both Clubs and
*chart*. There's no "d" in they/them, though.]{.spin}

rank on the next table.
