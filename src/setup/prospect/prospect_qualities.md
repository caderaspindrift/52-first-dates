# Is This an Ideal Partner? {#setup-prospect-qualities}

During the Headmate creation part of the game, you wrote one quality that the
Headmate was looking for in an ideal partner.
Now it's time to see if the Prospect measures up to that ideal. Here's how you
do that.

1.  Each player except the player in the Date role takes one of the completed
    Headmate sheets. This leaves one left-over Headmate, so one of the players
    should take that and thus have two Headmate sheets in front of them.
 
2.  In order, each player reads off the name of the Headmate and their ideal
    date quality to the Date player.

3.  That player then turns over the top card from the System's Deck.

4.  The Date records the name of the Headmate and that quality on the Date Sheet,
    on one of the blank lines.

5.  Then the Date turns over the top card of the Date's Deck.

6.  If the cards **don't match at all,** the Date leaves that box blank.

7.  If the two cards **match colors,** then the Date puts a check mark
    in the box on line of the Date sheet.
    This means the Prospect possesses that quality to a moderate degree.

8.  If the two cards **match suits,** the Date marks a plus sign ("+") in the box instead; 
    this means the Prospect has this quality to a high amount.

9.  If the two cards **match ranks and colors,** the Date marks a star instead;
    this means that the Prospect is a near-perfect match for that quality.

10. If the two cards **are identical** -- which is possible because they're drawn from
    two different decks -- then the Date marks two stars, one in the box and one to the
    left of the box. The Date is a perfect match on that quality.

11. If the two cards **match ranks but not colors,** the Date marks a minus sign ("-");
    this means the Prospect is the exact opposite of the desired quality.

12. Continue this method until all of the Headmates' criteria have been addressed.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here's an example. Let's say the Headmate's desired criteria is
"enjoys tabletop RPGs" -- so that they have someone to share their hobby with.

The player holding that sheet and the Date both flip cards; we'll keep the player's card
consistent, with a Two of []{.hearts} Hearts, and examine different draws by the
Date.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .nine .c}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this case, the cards don't match at all. The Date doesn't put any mark on that line.
The Prospect isn't into TTRPGs.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .ten .d}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards' colors match. The Date marks a checkmark in the box. The Prospect plays TTRPGs,
hooray!

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Seven of Hearts]{.card .seven .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The colors match, but more important, the suits also match. The Date puts a "+" on the
corresponding line. The Prospect not only plays roleplaying games, but really likes the hobby.
Maybe they're a gamemaster, or just a die-hard roleplayer?

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards exactly match, one from each deck. 
[There's a 1 in 52 chance of this happening, which is 1.92% of the time.]{.dera}
["Never tell me the odds."]{.aura}
[Han Solo is kind of a creep, though.]{.carline}
We can intrepret this as not only does the Prospect play tabletop RPGs as often as
the Headmate, *but also* their group is looking for a new player!

The Date player marks a star in the box, and an extra star on the outside. (If the
Date had drawn the [Two of Diamonds]{.card .deuce .d} instead, they would mark
just a single star.)
[There's actually as much of a chance of this happening as matching the suit.]{.dera}

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Spades]{.card .deuce .s}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Uh oh. The ranks match, but the suits don't match either color or suit.

The Date marks a "-" in the box. Not only does the date not play tabletop roleplaying
games, but actively *dislikes* them. This could spell problems for that Headmate.
