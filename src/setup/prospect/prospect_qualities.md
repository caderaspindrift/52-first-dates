# Is This an Ideal Partner? {#setup-prospect-qualities}

During the Headmate creation part of the game, you wrote one quality that the
Headmate was looking for in an ideal partner.
Now it's time to see if the Prospect measures up to that ideal. Here's how you
do that.

- For each Headmate, the Date writes the Headmate's name and desired quality on a line on the Date Sheet.
- One player flips the top card from the System's Deck and the Date flips a card from the Date's Deck.
- If the cards **don't match at all,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality.
- If the cards **match color,** the Date marks a check on that line; the Prospect has that desired quality.
- If the cards **match suit,** the Date marks a plus (+); the Prospect has that quality in abundance!
- If the cards **match suit and rank,** the Date marks a star; the Prospect is a perfect match on that quality!
- If the cards **match rank but not suit or color,** the Prospect doesn't have that quality at all. The Date marks a minus (-) on that line.

::::::::::::::::::::::: example ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here's an example. Let's say the Headmate's desired criteria is
"enjoys tabletop RPGs" -- so that they have someone to share their hobby with.

The player holding that sheet and the Date both flip cards; we'll keep the player's card
consistent, with a Two of []{.hearts} Hearts, and examine different draws by the
Date.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Nine of Clubs]{.card .nine .c}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this case, the cards don't match at all. The Date doesn't put any mark on that line.
The Prospect isn't into TTRPGs.

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Ten of Diamonds]{.card .ten .d}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards' colors match. The Date marks a checkmark in the box. The Prospect plays TTRPGs,
hooray!

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Seven of Hearts]{.card .seven .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The colors match, but more important, the suits also match. The Date puts a "+" on the
corresponding line. The Prospect not only plays roleplaying games, but really likes the hobby.
Maybe they're a gamemaster, or just a die-hard roleplayer?

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The cards exactly match, one from each deck. 
[There's a 1 in 52 chance of this happening, which is 1.92% of the time.]{.dera}
["Never tell me the odds."]{.aura}
[Han Solo is kind of a creep, though.]{.carline}
We can intrepret this as not only does the Prospect play tabletop RPGs as often as
the Headmate, *but also* their group is looking for a new player!
The Date player marks a star in the box. 

:::::::::::::: cardgroup ::::::::::::::
[Two of Hearts]{.card .deuce .h}
[Two of Spades]{.card .deuce .s}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Uh oh. The ranks match, but the suits don't match either color or suit.

The Date marks a "-" in the box. Not only does the date not play tabletop roleplaying
games, but actively *dislikes* them. This could spell problems for that Headmate.
