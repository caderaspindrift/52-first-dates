Creating a new Prospect happens before each Date Night -- unless you're going
on a second date with someone from a previous Date Night.
As with creating the System and the Headmates, creation of a new Prospect
involves input from everyone.

The steps to creating a new Prospect are:

1. Name the Prospect
2. Determine the Prospect's pronouns
3. See how the Prospect compares to the ideal
4. Describe the Prospect's appearance
5. Draw 2 cards for Traits

Each of these is detailed in the following sections.

## Gender and Attraction

One thing that *isn't* on the list is "determine the Prospect's gender
and attraction." Why's that?
[An earlier draft had this section as "Gender and Sexuality," but we realized
that sexuality isn't really the only thing we're talking about here. So 
we switched it to "attraction".]{.carline}

The assumption for game purposes is that the Prospect's gender and attraction
are going to be generally compatible with the System's gender and attraction.
While this is rarely a reasonable assumption to make in real life, it works
for purposes of the game -- because this ultimately isn't a game about being 
rejected by queer people, either by the System or by the Prospect.

Which means that it's handwaved as a non-issue -- if you need more of an
explanation than that, you can say that the friend-who-set-up-the-blind-date
[Speaking of the "friend", if you ever need to figure out details about said
mutual friend, such as their name or pronouns, you can use the tables for
creating a Prospect for them as well.]{.dera}
knows the System and the Prospect well enough to make sure that they at least
have a *chance* to hit it off in terms of compatibility.
