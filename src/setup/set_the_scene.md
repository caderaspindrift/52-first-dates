With a setting, optional themes, the System, the Headmates, and the Prospect
all worked out, you're just about ready for Date Night!
All that's left to do is decide what the date will be and where it will take
place.

The best way to do this is by consensus, but if that doesn't work for your
group, you can use this method: 

The Opportunity player chooses what the
date will be -- such as meeting over coffee, a dinner and a show, or
a queer pride parade -- and the Date player determines where it exactly
it takes place. Each of the Collective players gets to name one special
thing about the location, such as the type of people present, a unique feature
of the location, or the type of movie or restaurant.
