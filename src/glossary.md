# Glossary of Game Terms {#glossary}

Before we dive into game mechanics, these are the terms used in the game.

Player
~   This means what you think it means -- one of you who are reading this
    and, hopefully, playing the game at some point. There are no 
    gamemasters in this game, only players.

The System
~   A fictional character created by all the players and played jointly between
    all of them. This character is a plural system, and has been set up
    on a date by a friend.

Headmates
~   One of the members of the System's plural system. While there are as
    many headmates as there are players, a headmate is *not* tied to one
    player as "their" character.

Date Night
~   This is the actual event of the blind date between the System and the
    Date character. It doesn't have to take place at night; you can have
    it happen at any time. 
    When Date Night occurs, the Prospect character is created (or carries over
    from a previous date), and the roles are assigned.

The Prospect
~   For any given Date Night, this is the fictional character the System
    has been set up with for a blind date. The Prospect has their own desires
    and personality, separate from those of the System.

Roles
~   For Date Night, there are three roles: **The Date**, **The Fronters**,
    and **The Outside Interference**. These change between dates, and may
    change during a date as well. Roles are determined randomly at the
    start of Date Night.

The Date
~   The player who is currently controlling the fictional actions of the
    Prospect character, playing their cards to help describe how the
    Prospect acts toward, and reacts to, the System.

The Fronter(s)
~   The player or players (for a game with 4+ players) who are actively
    controlling the System by playing cards. With more than one Fronter,
    they alternate turns between each other. The Fronters roleplay the
    System as whichever Headmate is fronting at the time, which can
    change during the game.

The Outside Interference
~   The player who is controlling "the rest of the world", and introducing
    elements into the fictional Date Night to complicate the potential
    love connection between the System character and the Date character.

The Date Deck
~   The deck of cards from which both the Date and the Outside Interference
    draw their cards.

The System Deck
~   The deck of cards from which all the Fronters draw their cards. It's
    a good idea to a System Deck with a different card back than the 
    Date Deck, as the two will get mixed together frequently.

The Date Status Stacks
~   A row of three cards, situated between the players, upon which they
    play their cards. Only the top card matters, so the Status Stacks
    don't need to be laid out like solitaire game -- just as three 
    distinct piles.

End of the Date
~   When all of the cards on the Status Stack show the same suit or the
    same rank, it's time to wrap up that Date Night. The cards determine
    if the System and the Date share an intimate moment, want to date
    again, both, or neither.

Achieving Intimacy
~   One of the two main outcomes of Date Night. "Intimacy" is a deliberately
    broad term, allowing this to include everything from physical sex to
    a long night talking about feelings, at the option of the players.

Getting a Second Date
~   The other main outcome of Date Night. The Prospect character is willing to
    see the System again, and the players collectively can decide if they'd
    like to do that, or go on a date with someone else.

Aftercare
~   This is another broad term, adapted from the TTRPG Safety Toolkit.
    It's a recognition that even dating vicariously through a fictional
    character can stir up emotions, and players may need time to process
    those.
