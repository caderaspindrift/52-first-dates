# 52 First Dates

[]{.gamename} is a rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for 4 or more players
about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session (or even ever)!
More likely you'll just play out a few, either a pre-arranged number or until
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop.
