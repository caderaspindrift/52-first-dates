# 52 First Dates

A rules-light tabletop roleplaying game about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* 
You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session. More like a few, until all 
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop for the day.

## What You Need

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least 3 players, preferably 4 to 6
- Two decks of standard poker cards, they should have different backs
- A copy of the System Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- Several copies (see below for an exact number) of the Headmate Sheets
- Pencils
- *optional* extra paper for notetaking

The number of players determines the system size, and thus the number of
headmate sheets you'll need.

 Players       System Size
------------- ------------- 
 3 players     3 headmates
 4 players     6 headmates
 5 players    10 headmates
 6 players    15 headmates
 7 players    21 headmates
 8 players    28 headmates
