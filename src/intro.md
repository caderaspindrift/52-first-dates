# 52 First Dates

A rules-light tabletop roleplaying game about going on 52 blind dates while plural.

*Well.* 
You probably won't play out 52 dates in one session. More like a few, until all 
the players agree they've enjoyed playing and are ready to stop for the day.

## What You Need

Okay, you need to get the following together:

- At least 3 players, preferably 4 to 6
- Two decks of standard poker cards, they should have different backs
- A copy of the System Sheet
- One Date Sheet per player
- Six Headmate Sheets
- A copy of the Outside Interference Sheet
- One Game Reference Sheet per player
- Pencils
- *optional* extra paper for notetaking

The number of players determines the system size, and thus the number of
headmate sheets you'll need.
