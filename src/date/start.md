During the Date Night part of the game, the Date character and the System 
character alternate turns back and forth.

If you have more than three players, two or more players will be sharing the
System character, and will take turns in alternating order.

The Outside Opposition player doesn't have a turn in the turn order, but can
act in response to cards played by the other players.
