# A System Introduction {#our-system .nobreak}

Like many tabletop roleplaying games, []{.gamename} is a collaboration between
a group of people.  Unlike many, that group are all in the same body.

Hello! We're the Spindrift Crew!

This is a departure from the way we normally write TTRPGs, which is to try and
maintain a consistent voice throughout. We're purposely doing things differently
for []{.gamename} because we think it's important for this game, and thematically
sound.

Rather than interjecting comments into the flow of the text, we decided to use
sidenotes in the gutters, each signed with an emoji so you know you who's speaking.

This is who we are:
